Perfect little pour over,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",We love this thing. It's smaller than I pictured but it's perfect for one or two people who drink coffee like we do (half a pot or more per person). My neighbor used to come over 3 mornings a week to workout together and I'd always make us coffee with this and she loved it so much she bought herself one. Highly recommend.,Kaden Kennedy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de junio de 2024

Not worth the money,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I already used the ""pour over"" method with a ceramic Melitta No. 2 filter holder when I bought this coffee maker. I bought it so that instead of making myself 2 separate cups for breakfast (2 filters, and 2x coffee grounds) I make 1 larger pot that would keep warm. Here are my problems with this product:

1. The vessel glass is VERY thin - which means it doesn't hold heat well. Even with preheating it with boiling water and using a cozy, it didn't keep the coffee hot enough for the 2nd cup (yes, I know I can microwave it, but that's not the point)

2. Because the glass is so thin, you need to be very cautious when washing it.

3. The cone filter holder is shaped like a real cone with a point at the bottom. While the supplier provides you with some, most of the ones you can buy in the grocery stores are made for the Melitta system, where the cone has a flat bottom. You can use the flat bottom filters, but they don't fit quite right, and for what you pay this shouldn't be an issue

4. My glass lid cracked for no reason after 2 uses. It was sitting on the counter overnight and I woke up to find it cracked, must have been a manufacturing defect. I approached the seller for a replacement lid, but they were unable to provide one ( I would have paid for it). So, they are selling very fragile items with 3 parts, but if one breaks, you have to buy the whole system again. This is not sustainable... understandably easier for the seller, but not right.

So on the whole, I would recommend that you buy a ceramic Melitta filter and a ceramic tea pot with an opening large enough for the filter if you want to make more than one cup at a time with the pour-over method.",Christine Pompeo,Revisado en Canadá el 17 de marzo de 2024

Slow results,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This product is smaller than I thought, the small filters that come with it work slowly, drop by drop, takes a lot of time to filter your coffee.",Milton C. Hondrakis,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de marzo de 2024
"Solid, would not recommend to beginners","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Overall an alright product, no major flaws.
-Cloth filters work, but it recommend rinsing before use
-Carefe is pretty and pours very well, but made of very thin glass
-top part is alright, not made of real wood but serves its purpose

For someone like me who is trying to move away from instant and takeout coffee, I would not recommend this product. Please buy a french press, it will make better coffee 8 times out of 10, even if it is a little more work.",Chris M.,Revisado en Canadá el 13 de marzo de 2024
I love this thing,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS. Coffee making for me has never been easier, it’s so easy to clean and my coffees come out great and the clean up is AMAZING.

"This Product is very deceptive, and over priced.","1,0 de 5 estrellas","The coffee ""Pour Over Maker Set"" is very misleading, because it only holds 2 mugs of coffee. Which is about 12 oz of coffee.

Perfect for two big cups,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I got tired of drinking my coffee pushed through the plastic of K-cups, they are convenient but wasteful and expensive. On the hunt for a pour over that did not allow my coffee to contact anything but glass, I chose this one and it works great. My wife often times only drinks coffee on the weekends so I usually need a cup or two. This works perfect-easy to clean and has been durable. I like being able to control the strength of my coffee via the grind and concentration. I also prefer paper filters for ease and taste. If you want more than two large (or three small) cups, this one is too small. When making one cup the glass filter assembly fits nicely on every mug I own and there’s no carafe to clean. To clean I just rinse with water because I’m sensitive to soap taste in my coffee no matter how often I rinse. S wipe with vinegar does the trick if you think it’s needed but I haven’t. Only wish they made a larger one say 34oz for when company is over. I would like to own both sizes. I would buy again.",Drew,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de febrero de 2024

"Schick + Kaffee schmeckt, im Grossen und Ganzen: Yay! 🤗 ...","4,0 de 5 estrellas","PRO:
- Schick durch die ungewöhnliche, leicht eckige Form, sowie Filterfuss in schönem Walnuss, sauber verarbeitet ohne raue Kanten und Flächen, sowie sauber angepasstem, durchaus dicht sitzendem Silikonring an dem ich bisher kein dazwischen laufendes Wasser feststellen konnte
- Filterglas sauber verarbeitet
- Kannengriff liegt angenehm in der Hand
- Silikonring am Kannendeckel lässt sich problemlos zum Abwaschen entfernen und wieder aufsetzen um hier dazwischen laufendes Wasser zu vermeiden

Minimale Mankos:
- an meiner Kanne ist die Füllbeschriftung leicht schief aufgedruckt
- zwischen den sehr eng gearbeiteten Spiralen bleiben beim Ausspülen, sowohl aussen wie innen, kleinste Wassertröpfchen hängen, die man nicht mit einfach drüber wischen mit dem Geschirrtuch wegbekommt (kann man natürlich einfach trocknen lassen 😏)

Couldn't be more impressed,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is my first ever pour over brewer and today was my first time trying it. Real newbie here.

The first thing I thought when I opened it yesterday afternoon was how beautiful it was. I find it looks even prettier in person than it does online. And such a nice size.

Today I got to use it for the first time, and despite some fumbling around trying to learn to make pour over coffee for the first time, I STILL managed to make myself the best cup of coffee I have ever had. This is the only way I ever want to make coffee again.

All the elements of the coffee just came together perfectly. Honestly, I made it a bit strong and usually I hate strong coffee as it tastes bitter to me. But when I had another sip, I realized it was just so perfectly blended that I wouldn't have changed a thing.

I'm in love with this system.

I also love how you can put the filter in the carafe's top to drain when not using the top, I was happy to get a filter holder that was glass as I felt sure that would not impart any taste to the final coffee. And the wood adds such a beautiful accent. Just looking forward to using it for years to come.",Bardia,Revisado en Canadá el 3 de octubre de 2023

A really nice addition to my coffee collection,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","There are two competing methods for making great ground coffee: press or pour over. If you go to a gourmet coffee shop you will see pour over more frequently now as it has proven to be ideal for extracting the best coffee flavor and it gives you complete control of the grind, water temperature and ground saturation.
This pour over carafe is nicely built and attractive. I generally don't make enough to justify filling the entire carafe, but it's a nice option when there is company. The included filters make this an easy way to get started and as long as you treat the glass with respect it will last you a long time.",S.

Great for beginners/pour over,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I started with aeropress and still use it but finally dipped into trying pour-over and this is just as easy to clean/setup as aeropress in my opinion! I also like the filters it comes with. Quick tip: try different grind sizes for pour over even with the same coffee you use for aeropress, the flavor profile can be a bit different and might need larger/smaller grind size. My experience is go for slightly larger grind size and try water temps 90-95°C . Decaf can go lower like 80-85°C but it's all preference.
