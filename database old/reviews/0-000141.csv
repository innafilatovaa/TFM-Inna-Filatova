Read the fine print,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",Big mistake. Or should I say little; this french press isn't even big enough to make one decent sized mug of coffee. It's ridiculous.

Buy a different French press,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Okay folks, you're going to read a lot of reviews talking about how using the French press is the best way to make coffee. I agree that a French press makes a good full bodied flavorful cup of coffee. I've been using them for over 20 years and have had them in different sizes over the years. This review is for THIS French press not the French press in general.

Because these don't keep the coffee hot for long and because I drink multiple cups of coffee in the morning, I use an auto-drip coffee maker with a thermal carafe. I like to use the small French press to make my single afternoon cup of coffee. I was recently forced to buy a new one after I dropped my old one and cracked the glass.

This French press is NOT one of the better ones. It's a nice looking design but you have to force the lid down to get it on securely. It's equally awkward to remove. I find that I have too many coffee grounds end up in my cup. It's normal to have some with a French press but not this many. You'll have to stop pouring well before you get to the bottom. I'm a huge fan of making coffee with a French press, but you're much better off buying the Mateebake or similar one around the same price point. This French press isn't terrible, but your money is much better spent with a different brand.",Kenneth A. Harrison,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de enero de 2024

False advertising!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",They advertise this as 2 cup capacity but just looking at it tells you it is not even close. I tried pouring a 2 cup portion into it and around 20% spilt out.

The lid is a poor fit - easy to knock over,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I wouldn't recommend this.My husband wanted a caffetiere which has a lid lined up with the handle in such a way that the strainer is in the correct position when you pour.
Although the dint in the lid does line up with the handle the lid itself is a poor fit and the whole thing seems a bit top heavy unless the plunger is fully depressed so it has been knocked over several times already Just a light touch is all it needs to knock it off balance. It seems as though the base could be weighted better and the lid should fit more snugly. Similar to one we had previously but for the price this one is nowhere near as good in terms of quality",po hayward,Revisado en Reino Unido el 17 de diciembre de 2023

Defective jugs,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","The 1st press I bought was great, particularly the filter which retained its shape and function long after other models had given up.

Two months later we managed to damage jug no.1 - see photo - and took out jug no. 2. To my surprise, the filter was damaged - see photo. The filter of jug no. 3 was ok but very difficult to get in the jug so I imagine it won't be long before that filter also becomes defective. The problem seems to be that the internal diameter of new jugs 2 and 3 is about 2.5mm less than the first one I bought. I really don't want to go to the hassle of packing and returning them.

I have them relegated to their own specific uses, one for tea and one for coffee, and then the one I keep boxed in the gift closet because I love giving these as little gifts! This particular press does all the stuff a normal press does, however...and this was big one for me. The carafe rotates freely in the holder with the least amount of pressure, whereas the ones I have purchased from Bodum do not rotate in the holder. When I'm cleaning this thing and invert the holder the carafe will literally fall out, so beware! The risk of a burn from boiling water or very hot liquids of any temperature have left me very uneasy using this press. I won't return it because it does work.

Was a great little press for one cup!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I got this press and used it for 3-4 months. It was my first french press and worked 100%. It made enough for one standard mug of coffee. I started drinking 2 cups in the mornings so I would just pour boiling water into the coffee grounds for the second cup which was just as good as the first.

I had it on the top shelf of the dishwasher and when I tried to pull it out this morning it was stuck on the pegs, I wasn't gentle enough and the glass broke off as I pulled it out so there you go. A right off... it worked very well for the time I had it and it was under $20 so it paid itself off in that time.

I just ordered another one, this one is metal so I won't have the same issue next time. Plus it's more than double the size but not huge. Can easily have 2-3 cups made at one time.

Great french press,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Very satisfied with me purchase. Makes great coffee for a fraction of the price and space and the glass feels very durable, it wont break easily. I use this for an 8oz cup of coffee at my desk in the morning at work. Here is how i make it

- 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds
- 8oz hot water (between 195f and 200f for best results)

- put coffee grinds into press
- add enough water to cover grounds
- let sit for 30 seconds
- add the rest of the water
- cover with the top and plunger at open position
- let sit for an additional 2 and a half to 3 minutes
- slower plunge down
- pour into cup immediately

As with all french presses you need to grind the coffee beans on a coarse setting. Let the coffee sit for a minute or 2 to let the excess sediment settle at the bottom and be sure not to drink the last bit of coffee as that is where all the sediment (excess grinds that didnt get caught by the plunger) will be.

The press is easy to clean i rinse mine, cup and plunger, when im done drinking the coffee and wipe out the inside with a paper towl. Then i place the plunger upside down on the top of the press to help the rest air dry for the next day. In the picture i posted you can see the this press wont be able to make more than 8oz of coffee.

Used twice but glass beaker broke while cleaning the second time,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","‚Ä¢ Your review should focus on specific features of the product and your experience with it. Feedback on the seller or your shipment experience should be provided at www.amazon.com/feedback.

Thought I was adhering to the above guideline when I submitted this for a review that was rejected for not following the guide submission guide lines - I assume. This was among my comments:

""Following instructions for thorough cleaning I was rotating the hard plastic handle to align the holder to the pour spout for separating it from the beaker when it broke.""

I hope this review adheres to guidelines and is not considered a rant for trying to express a valid user opinion.

I don't know how different to say it except ""it is what it is"". It broke during CAREFULLY EXECUTED, thorough cleaning steps. Anyway, I went back and reviewed the low star ratings by a few users and saw carafe breakage was a main issue for the few low (1 and two) ratings. That being said, glass is glass and not the most durable material for such torqueing as it is subjected to when removing the handle, in this model, for the ""thorough cleaning"". For whatever reason my purchase snapped at the carafe spout - known fact.

I found the coffee it made excellent tasting and general cleanup easy. Had it not broken as described above, I would have given it a 5-star. Apparently, the overwhelming number of high star ratings by so many satisfied users means I am among the very low population that experienced this problem. I could find no means of getting a replacement carafe short of reordering this item again so I sought an alternative and decided to replace it with a stainless steel model (through Amazon) rather than running the (small?) risk of it happening again.

This product is very reasonably priced and a whole repeat purchase of it was strongly considered but in the end I decided on the more durable stainless steel option for a slightly higher price. I would not discourage others from considering this product but just weigh durability into a purchase decision.",Kindle customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de febrero de 2021

Great value for the money!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is the second time I've bought this 2 cup French Press. Don't worry, the first one is still going strong; I just wanted one for my office.

As someone that loves coffee but wants to cut down his consumption, but also isn't crazy enough to quit coffee altogether, this French Press is perfect! Sure, I could set up my automatic coffee brewer and have fresh coffee when I get in, but who has the will power to resist a full 12 cup carafe of coffee every day? ""Make less!"" you say? Well then what's the point of a coffee maker that makes 12 cups?

With the 2 cup capacity of this French Press, the first round is enough to satisfy the day, and if I feel I want to make another 2 cups, I need to search my soul to see how badly I want to wait the 4 minutes again, plus the clean up.

2 scoops of coffee some hot water, 4 minutes of time, and quick push on the plunger and delicious coffee every time. Easy to clean and not much larger than a large cup, this little wonder has lots going for it.

Then pour you coffee into a regular cup. The coffee will be pretty strong and won't fill the cup. Add water to top off, and then a little extra in microwave to bring up to temp.

"Convenient, but...","4,0 de 5 estrellas","This Is the first time I tried a French Press. I found it to be covenient and the resulting taste for both coffee and tea was at least as good as, if not better than brewing by conventional methods.
Since I drink only one cup of either coffee or tea a day, I bought this single cup French Press.
I purchased this one based on price and to a somewhat lesser degree, on other customer's
'reviews'.
So many reviews end with customers stating the disclaimer that they purchased the item at a DISCOUNT, in exchange for their 'fair', or 'honest',
or 'unbiased' review of the product!
I have been seeing a lot of such 'discounted' and 'unbiased' 'reviews' in customer""s reviews lately, and frankly, I don't think Amazon should allow this type of 'review'; common sense tells you that an objective and honest review cannot be made on a product that was not really paid for.
I did NOT receive this item at a discount; I paid the advertised price on the Amazon site.
And this IS my unbiased review.
The two negatives are that while it is described as a single cup French Press, I find it's capacity to fall short. I sometimes have to remake another 1/4 or 1/3 rd cup.
And because the cylinder is so narrow, it's a bit of a chore to clean.
The convenience and resulting taste (of both coffee and tea) are positive, however.
Perhaps I will buy one a bit larger.",JJ,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de enero de 2016

Great little French press,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",Having been using a Keurig for a few years and have been relatively disappointed in the flavor. Some brands are better than others but overall the flavor was poor. I started grinding my own beans to use in the Keurig and it was slightly better but still lacking. As this little press was relatively inexpensive and seemed like not too much effort I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. The flavor of the coffee is so much better. My only complaint is that the two parts at the bottom (the seal and the metal filter) do not come apart and that makes it a little hard to clean. Sometimes some grounds get stuck between and the seal is not good. This can let some grounds into the cup. Even this little issue is minimal compared to the flavor of the coffee that comes out. If you are thinking about trying a French press this is a perfect little unit to test out. I can say with certainty that I am not going back to the Keurig any time soo n,Jim Racle,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de diciembre de 2019
Exceeded my expectations!!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Before I start, I have used it once. So I cannot speak truthfully about the durability. But what I can speak of is the amazing cup of coffee I had this morning!! I am not a huge fan of Community coffee. Or at least I didn‚Äôt think I was. I gave this Clever Chef a shot this morning using breakfast blend. It is not very coarse, but coarse enough.

I heated water in the microwave around 2:25 seconds for about 6oz. And used 2 tablespoons of coffee. Last night my thermometer put the time and 6oz close to 205f. I slowly poured the water over grounds after letting the water sit about 20-30 seconds. I gently stirred with wooden spoon and Placed the top on and let it sit for 4 minutes. Then slowly and uniformly pressed. The taste was out of this world!!!! Very impressed. I will also try grinding my own beans in the future.

For the price this press is going to be hard to beat! Follow the instructions and you will love this thing. I will probably buy another for work. I never knew Community Coffee could taste so good.

Cleaning was straight forward. I ran hot water over the filter plunger and glass part.

I already miss it...,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Had this thing for over a year and it JUST shattered! After seeing the glass issues, I've always tried to be quite careful in swiveling the glass. Unfortunately, as of today 9/13/2020, this is now no more. I barely moved it and it chipped and cracked away. If ONLY they sold a separate glass carafe replacement then I may consider buying that.

Easy to disassemble excluding the glass from the base (This is the only reason I gave Clean 1 Star). Easy to reassemble. Overall parts easy to clean. But cleaning would be pointless if you have to be worried every time you had to disassemble it or it broke early in your purchase!

Blends well. However, the closer you are to the bottom, naturally some might have escaped the filter. Don't use all of it or use a filter to get the extra coffee out, if you are frugal about it.

I LOVE this little guy,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is perfect for me, an only occasional drinker of coffee. I went online to see how to use it and since getting it in I've tweaked it to suit my taste more. I've gotten rid of my bigger bulkier single cup coffee maker in favor of this little guy and have not regretted it. I read some reviews from others on cleaning it and getting all the grounds out, but to be quite honest I do not go into as much detail. I rinse the filter, spray it from different angles with the sprayer, and let it dry. Once dry any remaining grounds come out anyway when you tap it lightly. I don't use it for anything else anyway so I don't sweat a few old grounds here and there. I do NOT mess with the filter more than necessary because getting it out of shape will cause grounds to escape it when plunging. I make sure before each use that the filter is as perfectly circular as it can be because that is the single most important aspect of this thing. Taking it apart to clean it so thoroughly would compromise that. I found out the hard way lol. I just wonder how many scoops of coffee others use-reading up on it I read a teaspoon per cup. Pfffft.

As good as the Bodum -- Maybe better,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This French press produces enough beverage to comfortably fill a standard mug, or fill a standard 6oz coffee cup about 1 1/2 times. I got this French press to brew ground cacao, which it does very well. I got this to use at work, but I also got the more expensive (and nearly identical) Bodum press to use at home. If I had to keep just one of the two it would be this one. The materials seem to be the same, and the designs are very similar. The glass on this is totally clear, whereas the Bodum's glass has writing all over it, which is not as elegant. The black plastic on the Bodum seems seems to attract the fats from the cacao more than the plastic on this model. At any rate the Bodum seems harder to clean.
On both models the plastic can be separated from the glass, for more thorough cleaning; both models are microwaveable (without the press top, of course); and both models have what looks like identical press/strainer disks.

I really can't see any reason to buy the Bodum over this model, which is $2 cheaper and as good or better than the Bodum. It's an excellent French press.",pixelslave,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de abril de 2019
Good except for minor design flaw.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Works fine, especially if you like the fuller taste of well brewed french press coffee (which I do). Perfect for a single cup (but no more).
But there is a design defect imo. I have several other large french press makers (all Bodum). They all have a place for the metal column/shaft to screw in to the bottom part of the filter. In this model, the end of the shaft has a removable screw. While it's easy to install/remove with just your fingers, you need to do this every time you clean the press. In my case, it's run through the dishwasher after each use.
This means that if you drop the small screw down over the sink (remember everything is covered with used coffee grounds) you need to fish it out of the garbage disposal. Or worse, out of the sink trap. So you need to remember to cover the drain opening if your likely to drop it. Which I guess I am.
Before you put into the dishwasher, put it back into the shaft and tighten well so it doesn't come out and clog the dishwasher pump.

The difference between a drip machine, and this is night and day. It doesn‚Äôt have a that hollow bitter taste and feel that most coffee has to me. Coffee from a French press tastes as good as coffee smells if that makes sense. I think that it‚Äôs because the water is not boiling hot.

Below Average Quality,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I have to say, right off the bat I was shocked at the size - this is my own problem because it clearly states in the title how small it is and that doesn't effect my review, but for the price it was a little disappointing.

The lid doesn't fit to the glass well, and it doesn't rotate so it remains 'open'. If you're brewing your coffee properly it won't lose too much heat, but it does have an effect. Also, I noticed the press/filter is a bit of a struggle (I needed almost 'too much' force) and grounds were stuck in it afterwards that I needed to scrub out, which is a little inconvenient. Additionally, the lid is a bit crooked.

French press works great but quality is not the greatest,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I have had both this French press and the Bodum French press, and I read the reviews on this one and was convinced to give it a shot after the connecting joint where the screen screws in failed on the Bodum brand one. The issue with that one is that since it is plastic, when you screw in the screen too tight it oushes against the threads and slowly strips away plastic until the point when the plastic will no longer even hold the screen in place.

This press seems to solve that problem by having a metal portion that is unable to be pushed against so that is no longer the weak point. The mesh seems finer than the Bodum which is nice and, and glass is of a similar quality. The quality of plastic is where this unit fails.

The Bodum feelsuch more pliable and impact resistant while this one is more brittle and hard. After just one drop offy kitchen counter this unit broke at the top near the lid, which now wobbles freely due to no longer being connected to the base stem. I've banged up the lid on the Bodum and dropped it multiple times and never have had this occur. Therefore the quality of the plastic is much better on that unit, while the rest of this unit is much better in regards to the other parts of the press.

I would still recommend it but I'm sad that you have to baby it as such, would recommend the manufacturer try to use a less brittle plastic.",Fabian C.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de mayo de 2019

I have rather generously sized coffee mugs in my house and this leaves a comfortable amount of space for all the cream and sugar,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","There is a small discrepancy in the description as of the time of my review, but I have contacted the seller, and I expect they will edit the description to fix this. At the time of purchase it is described as having a 16 fluid ounce capacity, but the actual capacity is 12 fluid ounces. I have rather generously sized coffee mugs in my house and this leaves a comfortable amount of space for all the cream and sugar I add to my cup. This press is well assembled, easy to clean, and I am fully happy with it. None of the parts feel flimsy, the mesh is nice and fine, and the assembly screws together snugly. I do not feel it is necessary to down rate it for the description flaw so long as it is edited soon, because I feel regardless of that minor thing, this is a fantastic little single-serving press.

2) The mesh filter doesn't filter or the seal is sealed.... something... both times I used it before returning it, there was sizable grounds in my coffee. I get that some will happen this was not typical

The instructions said to rotate the handle around to the spout to make it easier to remove. That does not work for this model as the handle will not rotate into the spout location due to the curvature of the spout and the narrow slot in the handle where it attaches to the beaker.

The worst French Press...,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This is the worst French Press I have ever purchased. The design is absolutely absurd which allows for coffee grinds to enter your coffee cup. This is all due to the handle that comes up and over the lip of the press. The top accommodations the piece of the handle which is an attempt to line up the pouring spout. However, it does not accommodate the press. Meaning you have to insert the press at an angle. Allowing for coffee grinds to come up and over the press.

Flimsy & Hazardous Glass,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","The glass shattered while reassembling after cleaning, a month after purchase. The instruction directs you to remove the glass from the handle for dishwashing, but it is fairly difficult to get the handle on and off the glass, and I had been worried this each time I attempted this process. The glass eventually shattered while reassembling, slicing my finger and scattering small shards all over my counter and floor. Other than that, I was pretty pleased with this little guy for the month I had it. Another 4 to 6 ounces would have been nice, but I worked around that by adding extra grounds at brewing, and extra water direct into my coffee cup or travel mug. If you buy it, I'd avoid disassembling the glass from the handle.",Eric G,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de noviembre de 2021

Great value for single cup french press,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Got this as I was tired of Nespresso and Keurig while working from home. This makes 12oz / single cup of coffee, which is equivalent to a Tall size at Starbucks or a bit larger than a medium at Tim Horton's (10z). If you usually buy a larger size coffee, I would recommend getting a larger french press.

It works. It filters the coffee ground very well for the month I've used it.",GalacticaGateGuardian,Revisado en Canad√° el 29 de abril de 2020
Makes one great cup of joe,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","In my first foray into a brewing method other than ""cheap Target water boiler,"" I decided to get a French press. Gone are the days of over-boiled water and bitter coffee/mornings. This French press will make one cup of coffee (i.e. about the size of a small mug). It's easy to hand wash and the one-page guide provided clear instructions on how to take it apart. It also has basic instructions on how to use it, how long to wait for, etc. Other than the glass and the black plastic, the pieces are made of metal. Can't say much for its durability, since I've only been using it for about two weeks, but it seems sturdy enough.",T.J. Lam,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de febrero de 2018
Perfect Cup for One,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this in preparation for an upcoming trip. After reading the description, I was expecting to assemble it but was pleased to see that it came all put together. It is the right size cup for one person. I made my coffee with it this morning and it was the perfect pour. Also, it appears that they may have altered the design a bit as the plunger is not able to be disassembled (which is fine by me). I recommend this for those who want good french press coffee for one. Also, I appreciate that it does not appear easy to damage. Will know more about that later.",Maya,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de mayo de 2018

Great Coffee Press When You Are The Only Coffee Drinker In Your House!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","What I love most about this press is it only makes a single 8 to 10 ounce cup which is all I need to make for myself when leaving the house in the morning. The bigger multi cup press tend to not make the best small cup coffee and most of the time I end up wasting a cup of coffee to make a cup of coffee.

Some have been critical of its size, however it is as they say a ""single serve"" size.
As you can see from my image...here is the actual size of the Press and the coffee mug I filled from it. My mug is quite large so the Press does not fill it to the top but it fills it to the desired quantity.

Just what I was Looking for,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I use this to make coffee almost daily at work.

Super easy to use. One scoop of coffee grinds, add hot water, let it sit a few minutes, and pour. Makes a good cup of coffee for ine person.

Some grinds can get stuck in the filter but that doesnt make much difference.

Much better coffee than the office coffee pot. Takes more time and effort than a Keurig pod, but if you want a good cup of coffee without buying a Keurig, this is a great option.",Epic Stylee,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de diciembre de 2018

Fantastic coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","A french press coffee maker provides the best tasting coffee. They are easy to use and it takes no longer than 5 minutes to make a great cup of coffee. I also have a keurig and while it's great, the flavor of the coffee does not compare. Also, the coffee for the french press can be significantly less expensive. I have the larger presses but needed the single serve specifically because I wanted to try the dutch coffee which I had in a fine restaurant. Wow, it worked!

You do have to take apart the screen from time to time to clean it and that is not a big deal. Given the price of the little cups for the machines it pays for itself. It is glass and it can break.

Great for a single cup of coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Being a much smaller French press, it's important to make sure that your water isn't close to boiling when you pour it over the coffee. Otherwise the bloom will make the coffee expand and over fill the press.

This is great for wanting only a single cup of coffee. I only had a 32oz French press so I needed to brew no less than 12 ounces to make sure the plunger could actually push the grinds down.",D. A. Alford,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de junio de 2019
