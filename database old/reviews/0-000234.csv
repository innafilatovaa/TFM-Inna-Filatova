Me encanta,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Me ha gustado mucho tanto la forma, que me ha sorprendido para bien comparándola con alguna que he tenido antes, como la calidad de los accesorios.
El filtro mola bastante, tuve uno metálico totalmente y se le desprendieron los filtros de la estructura, este está bastante bien montado y parece súper resistente.
Súper fácil de limpiar, si tuviera que ponerle una pega es que, después de servir, la gota que suele quedar, se desliza y se queda en la pieza de corcho que la recubre, Eda parte no debe lijarse por lo que entiendo que en algún momento se pondrá feo donde penetra esa gota..",Silvia Muñoz,Revisado en España el 13 de diciembre de 2021

AMAZING!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","WOW! Have never had coffee made this way. So glad I decided to try it!

This thing is really amazing! I was expecting the coffee to taste pretty much the same as making it in a kcup mini filter insert after grinding whole beans. I was completely wrong. Coffee tasted way different and 100% better. Deeper richer flavor for sure. My only regret is not getting the bigger size. I purchased the 17oz but will definitely be getting the bigger one instead but keeping this one as well.

I am so burnt out on stupid K-cups. This is gonna be my coffee way from now on.

I watched many YouTube videos on how to do it correctly. The key is to heat the water in a pot to 190 deg. And let it cool to 185 then start the slow pouring process. Need a thermometer for sure at first but could go from eyeballing the water bubbles after a few makings.

Pouring the water slow and letting it drain is also key. That’s how the magic happens. So so so worth the wait for a beautifully luxurious tasting cup of coffee to start your day!!

Heated 16oz of water and used 2.5 scoops of freshly ground dark roasted beans. It was the perfect measurements for my liking.

Try it. You won’t be disappointed!",joebear30,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de mayo de 2024
Great pour over / drip coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Beautiful design and makes simple and straightforward drip coffee.

Minimal cardboard packaging. The cork wrap comes off easily so you can wash the glass properly.

Couple of things I found was that I didn’t know what the black pronged stick was at first, it wasn’t shown or clear on the instructions. I had to check out on the promotional video to find out.

I also found that the spoon was lodged/stuck in the glass container on first use, which I understand is for storage / packaging reasons. But it was really difficult and a bit of a challenge to get out at first!

Other than that, beautiful design and produces great coffee.",ah,Revisado en Reino Unido el 3 de mayo de 2024

雑味なく濃い目にドリップできるおしゃれな道具,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","届いた時点でフィルターの内側全体に曇りのような汚れがあったのは少々気になりましたが、洗えばきれいになったので問題ありませんでした。
500mlは少し小さいかなと思いましたが、マグカップにたっぷり2人分は淹れることができます。ビーカーのくびれの部分近くまで落としても、フィルターの底がコーヒーに沈むことはありません。（さすがにフィルターの方は容量ギリギリですが）
コルクのスリーブはつけたままだと落としたコーヒーの量がわかりにくいので外してドリップし、カップに注ぐ段階で取り付けています。このとき付属の革紐をつけなくても、スリーブを合わせただけで安定して持つことはできます。
軽く水洗いしながら一日使い終わった後にガラスビーカーを食洗器で洗い、スリーブと革紐を元通り取り付けてから収納しています。
ペーパーフィルターを使わないので紙のにおいが移らず濃いめにドリップできますが、どうしてもビーカーの底に微粉が溜まります。
ただビーカーは構造上かなり傾けても底にコーヒーが少量残るので、微粉の大部分はその中に残ってくれているようです。
デザインが可愛らしく収納時もインテリアになりますし、あまり気を遣わずにドリップしてもとても美味しいコーヒーになるので大変気に入りました。おすすめ。",manicafe,Revisado en Japón el 23 de abril de 2024

"Glass chips easily, new filter design, and smelly cork; otherwise wonderful","2,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this pourover coffee maker which I originally purchased a few years ago. This review is about the Bodum Pourover that I purchased in January 2024. I recently had to replace it because the original carafe chipped at the spout (after being handwashed).

Purchased a replacement but tossed the cork (smelled moldy). The new filter also has a new design and is shaped like a cone so our paper filters fit awkwardly. I prefer to filter my coffee for health reasons, so I tossed the new filter too. And the new carafe chipped after a few months of use, so I'm tossing that too. Bodum needs to make their glass products a little bit sturdier but I wouldn't purchase again for a new carafe because of the quality of the cork and new filter design.

-1 star for easy to chip glass (also excluded by the 1 year warranty)
-1 star for moldy cork",Sharon Wong,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de abril de 2024

長く使う上で、気になったことがあります。
1）コルクカバーをつけると、コーヒーをカップに注ぐ時に、手にはばかり注ぎにくいです。多分外したままで使います。
2）ガラスビーカーのくびれが強すぎて、洗いにくいです。くびれを広くしてもフィルターに影響がない仕様ですので、洗いやすさを優先して頂きたいです。",Amazon大好き,Revisado en Japón el 13 de abril de 2024

It makes your coffee!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","In general, this is a fine product. Coffee tastes great from, and life is good. I’m not a fan of the filter; it takes extra time to drain and is a little difficult to clear out all the grinds. Now listen, I recognize those issues are minor and I’m not losing sleep at night cursing the fault of the designer of this filter….much. I wish I would have kept the filter of the last carafe I had after accidentally smashing it on the tile floor. The old filter was absolutely perfect. That is all. So in conclusion, it makes great coffee and my A.Retentive nature is disturbed by the extra time it takes for the filter to drain and be cleaned. Still worth a purchase.",Black Bear,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de febrero de 2024
Very small coffee filter,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Overall, Bodum make excellent filter coffee products, and up to a point, this is no exception. The biggest fault with this 1/2 litre jug is the size of the filter. Like most people ( I suspect), I don't own a slow pour kettle, that means you have to pour the water onto the coffee grounds in three or four stages or it will overflow. Even gentle water pouring from an ordinary kettle won't alleviate this small problem.
The neck of the jug is also smaller than the larger Bodum jug, and therefore less easy to clean.
If you like filter coffee though, & all you want is a single mug, this is a great little jug that suits it's purpose well.",JayTee,Revisado en Reino Unido el 8 de febrero de 2024
Easy to Use and Great Taste,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This has been a great pour over coffee maker. It's easy to use with simple durable parts. It is easy to use and produces a great cup of coffee. I have been using a variety of coffee and I feel it's superior to the taste I get from a re-usable Keurig pod or even a premium Keurig pod. It's less bitter than my french press as well.

There are two small downsides. First, it's about 16oz of coffee. That is great for me, but it would not be efficient for 3+ people. No big deal - that's just how it is and I got it for basically making 2 cups at a time so I love it. The strap can be a little annoying because no matter where I put the drawstring it's still something you can feel when you old the coffee maker. It's not a design flaw - it just is there and you can feel it. Since I only pour 2 cups out of this, it has never been an actual problem.",M.

First off, the pot is fairly small, so you're not going to be able to make much more than a single cup or two, which may not be a problem for you. However the more concerning issue is the metal filter doesn't really do a great job at filtering, as small particulates will go right through. Just use regular paper filters. However, since the metal filter is also tiny, I haven't managed to find any generic paper filters (#2 sized filters are too large) that will fit.",Daniel M,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de diciembre de 2023

Nice dark strong coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this little coffee brewer. I use two tbsp of coffee and brew on this and it makes nice dark strong coffee. I also used a manual coffee bean grinder and made it pretty fine so it would also make good dark flavorful coffee. At any coarseness of the grinds, without a coffee filter paper in the strainer, it still let grinds through it. I just didn't pour all of the contents into my cup. I learned that if I left a little in the bottom and didn't stir it up too bad while pouring, none of the grinds made it to my cup. So then I tried a filter paper and none of the grinds made it through and it still strained it just as good. I'm buying a second one to take to work so I can have fresh coffee there too. Also this is a great alternative to people with very small spaces, no electric, or even camping or RV living I'm sure since it's so small and you just need some hot water to brew. I'm sure you could also maybe just maybe use it for loose tea. If you probably used 2 filters it would slow down the time the water passes through and brew it longer. I don't know. But I'm glad we bought this now and regret not buying sooner.",william,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de diciembre de 2023

Semble sympa et facile mais plus gadget qu'utile à la finale.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Acheter car je consomme peu de café et je souhaitais me séparer de ma cafetière électrique, je n'ai pas été satisfaite et convaincue de ce produit.

Le produit comporte beaucoup trop de plastique a mon gout, au vu du prix je trouve que ça aurait pu être éviter.
La cafetière fait le travaille en soi, rien de bien compliqué, si on l'utilise correctement on aura son café, si on est pas trop exigeant sur ledit café, ça ira.

Néanmoins :

- je n'ai trouvé aucune amélioration signifiante concernant le goût du café, je l'ai même trouvé plus fade (et j'en prends un de bon qualité)
- le filtre laisse l'eau s'écouler bien trop rapidement, ce qui ne permet pas d'infuser correctement le café et toute ses saveurs (d'où le côté fade)
- la forme du pot qui peut paraître idéale, n'est pas du tout pratique pour verser surtout lorsque c'est le fond de la cafetière, il faut presque le retourner complètement pour tout verser

A la finale, la bonne vieille méthode de la casserole associé a un bon filtre fait largement mieux car plus simple et bien moins cher.

Best way to make coffee!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",I typically have 1-2 cups of coffee per day. This is perfect for me. So easy and taste is fantastic! I’ll never brew electrically again.,Janny B,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de agosto de 2023
Almost Excellent..,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I am very happy with this coffee maker, using it every day.
A key design element was the washable/re-usable filter. In practice though the mesh is not fine enough, and the coffee is distinctly cloudy as a result. This is easily remedied by placing a regular paper filter inside or below (as you prefer) the plastic one supplied. This has the added benefit of keeping the hot water on the coffee for a little longer, for a stronger/richer brew.
Otherwise, the size is great for one big mug (500ml), or two regular cups.
Looks good & handles nicely. Cleaning is easy enough.

Exactly as Described!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is described as a 17oz pour over coffee maker. The average size of a single bottle of water, usually for one person, is 16.9 oz. Another, larger size is offered should you desire it. Larger size costs more, no surprise.
It is glass as described. There is a removable, easily removable, collar for comfort as described.
The cone from filter is a very good one. One of the best features in fact!! I’m old. I’ve had quite a variety of coffee makers and brands over the years and I cannot say strongly enough how great the filter is. Really!!
If you want a coffee maker that doesn’t function like a pour over, don’t buy this one.
If you want a pour over for more coffee than 17 oz. at a time, a large mug of coffee for instance, purchase the larger size.
This works perfectly for what it is designed for. It is a pity when people negatively influence other shoppers with their reviews because they didn’t choose correctly in the first place.
This is a review of fact, experience and opinion.

The product I received has an absolute garbage perforated sheet metal filter that completely blocks the coffee from coming through it at all.

Estetica e funzionalità,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","L'estetica di questa ""macchinetta del caffè"" è meravigliosa ed è quello che più mi ha spinto a prenderla.
Oltre ad un prezzo decisamente accettabile ed il paio di accessori di cui è dotata.
Arriva corredata di copertura in sughero, filtro da appoggiare sopra riutilizzabile, dosatore per il caffè, tappo.
Il sugero è resistente ed una volta versata l'acqua protegge le mani dalle scottature, è chiaramente sfilabile in modo da poter inserire la boccia di vetro il lavastoviglie: si slaccia il filo e si sfila per poi rimetterlo una volta che il vetro è asciutto. il filtro riutilizzabile può essere tenuto sia con che senza filtri di carta ma la pulizia è veramente facile e veloce che abbiamo deciso di no comprare i filtri in carta (rispetto ad orziere od altre metodologie di caffè), viene riempito e svuotato in un attimo.
Abbiamo questa dimensione ridotta in quanto beviamo poco caffè ma devo dire che è veramente veloce come preparazione ed anche come pulizia.

il Vetro non è spessissimo come sono abituata per altre tazze contenitore ma devo dire che è ben formata e per il momento (due settimane) stà reggendo parecchio bene.

Good coffee but take your time.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",So there is a trick to how to make good coffee using this pour over filter coffee pot. And it’s quite simple. You put the coffee grounds in the top filter. Then you press it down. Gently though. You don’t wanna break the thing. Then when the coffee grounds are likely compacted start pouring boiled water directly over the top of the coffee grounds very slowly. You’ll see the coffee grounds soak up the water and should now form a foam over the top of the grounds you can start to pour the boiled water faster into the filter now and this will slowly drip through to the coffee pot below. Once you’ve done this let it settle for about a minute then pour out and enjoy the coffee. for those that I found it produces weak coffee this is probably because you’re pouring the boiled water of a very loose coffee grounds far too quickly. So you’re ending up drinking basically hot water tinged with a taste of coffee. Take your time! I mean it. It might take you nearly a whole minute to pour the water into the filter. Or longer. It’s worth it don’t rush. Enjoy.,S. Khan,Revisado en Reino Unido el 3 de septiembre de 2021

Wonderful little coffee maker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","If you have the extra 5 mins in the morning to heat some water and grind some beans, this little coffee maker is a must have! You can alter the proportions as you see fit, and I quite honestly enjoy the coffee I prepare more than 9/10 cafes - certainly better than the piss you get at your average Tims or McDonalds. Rivalling Starbucks, but at a cost of X cents per cup vs $7+ per cup, you can't go wrong with this guy! The reusable filter is wonderful - I have had issues with small amounts of coffee grounds getting through, but if you leave a few drips in the bottom of the beaker, they won't get in your cup. Very easy to clean - make sure to rinse out the filter immediately after using so that it lasts longer.",Sam,Revisado en Canadá el 9 de julio de 2020
Una Maravilla,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Mi salto ha sido de tomar café instantáneo, a la prensa francesa a esta maravillosa cafaterita estilo Chemex.

Y bueno, hablar de lo bonita que está está de más porque la tengo hasta como adornando mi escritorio. El sabor es excelente a pesar de que no invierto en cafés de gama alta ni mucho menos, al compararlo con el sabor de la prensa, no es superior, es simplemente diferente; aunque PARA MI GUSTO, creo que me gustó más esta por la sensación general que tienen los aceites que se conservan...

This thing brews fast--,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is an interesting little brewer (500ml/17oz) that's both functional and attractive. It is a metal filter system, so you should expect fines and oil in the cup, regardless of what manufacturers say about it being similar to paper-filtered coffee. That being said, the fines are minimal for a metal filter system. That difference in taste and texture is why I bought this brewer, and something you should at least expect, if not enjoy if you are considering purchasing one. Your brewing technique will also have to change if you are used to brewing with paper, but I think it's easier to get it right than paper

Things to like:
-the coffee is full-bodied and textural
-the carafe shape does a nice job of trapping fines in the bottom during the pour because of the break angle between the bottom and top sections
-the opening on the 500ml(17oz) brewer is the perfect size for a plastic V60-2 dripper if you just want to use the carafe
-the upper part of the carafe will hold a ceramic dripper cone like a Loveramics or Origami dripper with room to brew about 500ml
-the carafe feels high quality
-it's easy to operate

Things to dislike:
-the filter does not have much room for coffee; I like to brew about 16g to 350g (weak, I know) and the filter is about half full at that point
-the filter feels cheap compared to the carafe; it's easy to see why looking at the price of something like the Abel Kone or Kinto Slow; the performance is still good
-it would be very difficult to get your hand inside to wipe with a cloth if you like to clean by hand
-the neck where you grip is rather large and could prove difficult to hold for smaller hands
-the pouring, while not messy, leaves a little to be desired; you have to pour fairly steeply

Silly gripes:
-the packaging is minimal and mostly cardboard, which is good, but they put the manual and scoop inside the carafe, making it very difficult to get out with adult hands: a little frustrating",Cody Spagrud,Revisado en Canadá el 18 de enero de 2022

Here’s why you’ll love this thing,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I’m more of a hot tea person and I drink coffee maybe only 3-4x a year. I have just never been an avid coffee drinker and much prefer other means of caffeine if I need some. The need for caffeine usually comes only when I get severe headaches— and even then, I usually get a dose from migraine medication.

Every once in a blue moon, though, I have an urge to drink coffee. Over the years, I’ve dealt with many a cumbersome coffee machine that I usually end up throwing out or giving away because it takes up too much space in my kitchen for as little as I use it. But then, every time I get that rare urge to drink coffee, I wish I’d had one again. One particular day a few weeks ago, I had that urge to drink coffee. I haven’t had a coffee machine in probably a good 3 years having given my last one away, so I figured I was out of luck. I don’t dare venture out into the public for a $5 cup of coffee I don’t need in the midst of a pandemic. I then remembered this adorable little coffee dripper I saw in a video I watched a while back. Though I’d never seen such a thing in person, I thought if any place would have some for purchase, it would be Amazon. Low and behold, Amazon did not disappoint. While browsing for a coffee dripper, I saw many different brands and styles. I ultimately settled on this one for a few different reasons.
1. The price is unbeatable
2. The reviews were plentiful and high
3. I like the sleek style with the cork
4. I prefer a coffee dripper that also comes with the glass carafe for a more all-in-one device.
5. It’s small and takes up hardly any space at all! Perfect for my needs.
6. The reusable filter

When I received this coffee dripper, my expectations were exceeded. Though the device is pretty straight forward and self explanatory, it comes with very clear, thorough instructions about how to use and care for it. It comes with a handy coffee scoop and a lid to use on the top after your coffee is done brewing. The reusable filter is a huge bonus because it’s less waste and a money saver. The cork outer not only looks nice, but it’s easily removable for cleaning and it’s really great for insulation (no burned fingers!) It’s really well made and feels nice and sturdy, it’s also very easy to clean. No electricity needed, no need to wait forever for the coffee to brew. The top benefits, though, are that it produces some of the BEST tasting coffee I’ve ever had, and it’s compact so I can store it away easily until the next time I feel like some coffee— how ever long that may be.

The bottom line is that I don’t think you’ll regret buying this. It’s wonderful to have!",loveadict44,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de agosto de 2020

My first ever Pour Over Coffee Pot & I absolutely ***LOVE*** it!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I’ve been wanting a part of a coffee maker for a while now. Finally decided to purchase one for my birthday and so glad I decided on this one. I went back-and-forth here on Amazon searching for the best pour over coffee maker, comparing all the reviews and this one had the best of everything. Just made my 1st cup of coffee, it’s absolutely delicious and I just had to write a review immediately afterward. The Bodum Pour Over CoffeePot is stylish, sturdy, comfortable to hold when hot and cold and it’s super easy to take apart and clean. I had two videos to upload but Amazon only allows one, so trying to include as much info as possible. I used 12oz of water and 2.5 level scoops of coffee for my xl coffee cup. I would suggest grinding your own beans if you have a coffee grinder. I use the prepackaged Gevalia Papua New Guinea coffee which is a fine ground. Took about 5-6 min to brew. Side noting that the coffee will not be too hot by the time brewing has completed due to the length of time it takes for fine grounds to brew. A slightly larger ground coffee bean would work best and would be hotter when finished. I add milk to my coffee, so that does tend to cook it down slightly also. Overall, I’m extremely pleased with this pot and the delicious cup of coffee it produced.

Comparing my experience to the other reviewer’s, the Glass is sturdy, it’s not thin at all, so as long as you don’t manhandle it roughly, you should be just fine. The cork is very comfortable in your hand, protecting your hand from the heat of the coffee and it is NOT hot at all to hold. It comes apart easily, simply squeeze the button, gently loosen the leather strap, and it slides right over. The cork pops right off, wash with soapy hot water and dry. Cork pops right back on and stays in place while you use two hands to replace the leather strap and re-tighten in place. Love this pour over coffeepot and highly recommend it. Don’t hesitate, it’s perfect! Two thumbs up!",Vanessa C.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de mayo de 2022
Favorite way to brew coffee now.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I ended up getting the bigger version, but my review I think remains the same:
This part isnt about the item itself, but rather how it was shipped from Amazon,which is one reason I'm returning it- when we received this, it was in an amazon box with other items, and it was not in its actual product box at all, nor was it even wrapped, I'm a bit uncomfortable with this because this item is 100% sold in a dedicated item box ( again, we ended up buying the bigger version from a physical store. )
That being said,
The item itself is fantastic,
It's the only way I make hot coffee now,
I read a lot of reviews making comments about the flavor and fullness of the brew, and I 100% agree there,
It was mentioned in different reviews that the essential oils from the coffee are able to stay in your brew since you're not brewing through a paper filter,
You can see a slight "" oil"" film when you swish the coffee inside the carafe,
The flavor and smoothness of the coffee made with this is unbeatable in my opinion, a lot of coffee I've had, no matter it's brew method ( with the exception of cold brew ) there's always the bitterness that just cuts through and stays on your tongue, some people like this, I don't,
The coffee from this has a very nice and smooth feeling, and is definitely not as bitter nor does it leave as sharp of an after taste.
The first cup I brewed from this, I was floored by how good it was, almost convinced it was just the cream and then realizing the only difference between the day before and this cup, was the brew method - but I even tried it hot and black, and it was still 10/10.

I make coffee every night before bed, and with the 34oz there's enough left in the carafe after making a 20oz mug, that I can let it cool and pour the rest into ice cubes to freeze over night and have coffee ice cubes set for the morning.
Before this, my preference was french press - but the cleaning process was always dreadful.
This item is so easy, the grounds come off the stainless steel filter like butter ( and you can easy reuse them in cleaning & skin care products, or even in your garden and for pests around the home. )
I would recommend having a brush to clean this with, but all in all I'm definitely happy with the item itself.
10/10 would recommend.",Charli,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de marzo de 2021
"Makes great coffee, If you have the patience","4,0 de 5 estrellas",This Pour over coffee maker is good to use but you do need to have a lot of patience as well as some trial and error with making the coffee. It is good that it comes with the filter included and it works perfectly to make it into a mug or a glass. It is a bit difficult to figure out how to make great coffee with this but once you do your research and with some testing and trying different methods it make an excellent cup of coffee. I would say this is not for your average person to make coffee but if you want a a great cup of coffee and have the time to sit and be with it for a few minutes it is great. I primarily use this on the weekends where I have some more tine in the morning to make it rather than during the week.,Joseph Yarka,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de marzo de 2023
Teure Nachhaltigkeit,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Natürlich, umweltbewusst, nachhaltig: Eigentlich sehr gute Eigenschaften. Aber sie treffen auf dieses Produkt nur sehr eingeschränkt zu.
Schwachpunkt ist die Verbindung zwischen dem aus einer Art Edelstahlnetz hergestellten Filtermaterial und dem aus braun gefärbtem Plastik hergestellten Gerüst des Dauerfilters. Sie löste sich bei meinem Exemplar etwa zwei Jahre nach dem Kauf. Das lässt sich nicht reparieren. Stellt sich somit die Frage, ob der Aufwand an Energie und Kosten bei der Herstellung dieses ""Dauerfilters"" gerechtfertigt ist.
Hier sei eine kleine Rechnung erlaubt: Gehen wir von 350 Filterungen pro Jahr aus, also 700 in zwei Jahren. 100 Papierfilter kosten etwa 1 €. Bei 700 Filterungen macht das 7€. Gehen wir weiter davon aus, dass ein Filter aus Plastik oder Porzellan schon vorhanden sei, ebenso wie eine passende Kaffeekanne. So stehen also 7€ für Papierfilter ca. 25€ für dieses Produkt gegenüber. - Möge also jeder für sich entscheiden.",RatherFatAthlete,Revisado en Alemania el 6 de octubre de 2021
"Cheap, defective filter of Dollar Store quality","1,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this for a gift and was greatly embarrassed when it turned out the filter that comes with this product is cheap piece of poorly constructed plastic, not the SS mesh filter AS ADVERTISED. The mesh doesn't even fully connect to the thin. plastic filter frame, rendering it completely unusable. You can see in the 2nd photo that it's melted (very sloppily) together. The plastic is thin and shiny, like the cheap products at the Dollar Store that are not meant to last long. Scoop and stopper are made from the same materials. Bodum used to have excellent products (I have 2 SS french presses), but this filter is a bad joke. I contacted the seller and will update my review if needed.

edit: 2 emails and 2 weeks later, I have not received a response from Bodum regarding the defective filter. I am returning this janky product.",It's been surreal,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de diciembre de 2020

There was a quarter of an inch of coffee grounds and sludge in the carafe. I am not looking to buy paper filters.... It's the whole reason i purchased a metal filter!!

Very disappointed!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Don’t waste your money!!! I’ve been using the pour over method for several years and am well skilled in this type of coffee brewing. I generally use the porcelain type of cone with the paper filters and you can brew a large mug of coffee very quickly. This thing is so ridiculously small, I had to add boiling water to it 7 times and it still wasn’t enough to fill a large mug. It’s about half the size that it should be. Additionally, if you prefer and stronger cup of coffee, the supplied filter and cone area is not large enough to accommodate the grinds.

Unnecessary plastic in filter,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",This is suitable for plastic lovers that wouldn’t mind brewing their coffee and knowing that hot water runs through a partly plastic filter and the filter at some point will end up in a landfill and the ocean.

Discription is deceptive,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This is NOT a double wall glass canister. The cork is double wall. That is why the cork is required to keep your hands from burning on the thin wall glass. If you love hot coffee and are counting on the canister of keeping your extra cups hot.......you may wish to rethink this one.
Pros: 1.) Inexpensive 2.) If cute is your thing, this is cute.
Cons. 1.) glass canister will not keep coffee hot for long. A thin wall glass couple with a top cover(?) that will allow great amounts of heat to escape. I really see no need for the top cover. Plus the pour over method allows heat to escape while pouring. It is all a down side for hot coffee lovers.
This is just another tool for the coffee toolbox. Flavor? It's all on the pour over knowledge and other tools, like the coffee scale. The Bodum pour over has nothing to do with flavor...it is all in your knowledge of what your taste is, preparation and performance of the pour.
2.) As others have said, my preference is using a filter. That I did find makes my coffee more suitable to my taste as it does collect the very fines that will pass with out the paper filter.
Overall, I take off 2 stars for deceptive advertising and one star for a poor design on the lid.
I will continue to use this during the summer months as I think even the second cup will keep me satisfied. Only making 1 cup vs 2 cups does not effect an increase in the heat of the coffee.
I may go back to the drip method during the winter, plus having more knowledge of grind to water mixture and the amount of time needed to brew just may make my drip maker better enough to forget the pour over..............time will tell. Hope this helps you hot coffee lovers ))))))",Tom,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de mayo de 2022
"Cute, but not practical","2,0 de 5 estrellas","While this is cute as can be sitting on my kitchen counter, it's almost useless. The pros of this are it saves electricity because you don't have a coffee maker plugged in all the time, and if you have a gas stove you can heat water that way. As for the cons it takes forever to make a cup of coffee. Forget this if you want to get up in the morning and have a quick cup of coffee. You are told in the video to pour the water over the grounds slowly and by the time you are finished pouring (can't pour all at once) the coffee is nearly lukewarm. Then there's the matter of the grounds seeping through the filter. Not tasty. If you try to use a filter it takes twice as long to seep through. I have had mine almost a month now and kept thinking I'd figure out a faster way to use it, but so far nothing has helped. And to me, the flavor of the coffee is not as good as it was in my old coffeemaker. Maybe I'll just use it as a flower vase.",Maggie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de enero de 2023
Smaller model didn’t have very ergonomic or smart design,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","My partner and I are down to 1 cup of coffee each morning so I thought the size would be a perfect replacement for an 8 cup chemex. But its just a poorly designed vessel. I like strong coffee, so I add a generous amount of grounds. The filter for coffee grounds is too shallow so I can only pour a small amount of water at a time which I results in an extremely slow manual pour. Also my partner and I must have really small hands because when grabbing the cork neck, my fingers go around half way, I always feel like I’m going to drop it. Also if I try to grab from the top, the filter is wider than the mouth of the vessel and will come off. It’s difficult to get the last bit of coffee out because of its odd shape so the bottom ends up having a dark line of coffee residue. I had to get a special brush to clean it. Lastly, the cork looks shabby when wet and taking that off to clean and fill with water all the time is pretty cumbersome. I have an aeropress, 8 cup chemex, moka pot, and French press all with their different uses and quirks, but I have to say that this is one of my least favorite coffee makers.",austinxx,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de abril de 2021
"Beautiful, but disappointing","2,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used Bodum products before and expected that this coffee maker would be good, but I'm disappointed. You definitely need to use a paper filter (which I was hoping to avoid to cut down on waste), otherwise the water seeps through the metal filter much to quickly. Even with a paper filter, however, the coffee it produces is weak.",Kam,Revisado en Canadá el 24 de septiembre de 2022
Exactly what I needed. Great coffee,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","**Update: I originally gave 5 stars. After using for a while, theres a major problem with the included filter. It's just not fine enough and A LOT of grounds get through. I had to buy another filter which costs as much as this entire kit. Should have just spent more and gone elsewhere to start. ***

I was looking at pour over kits 2-3x this price. Then I saw this little tiny thing and thought since I'd only be making pour over for myself and maybe the occasional guest, this should work just fine. The price was right so I went for it! It's available in larger sizes, but I bought the smallest one. It's super easy to use and to store away. If you put the little ""stopper"" back in upside down, you can put the filter right over it, so everything stores away nice and easy. I don't have a dishwasher and the odd shape will probably make it hard to clean by hand, but nothing a drop of bleach and a good soak shouldn't cover. There's really no need to waste money on something fancier, this thing looks great and does exactly what it's supposed to.",Dave C.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de junio de 2018
Missing reusable filter,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I was so excited for this to come, but the reusable coffee filter was missing, which is like 50% of the product. I tried to just get the missing piece, but the only option ended up being to return it unless I wanted to spend more money. It also had barely any padding, I'm surprised it didn't break in transit.

That said, the actual product was super cute and a great size. If I really needed coffee right away, I would have just put a reusable filter in it, but I want what I paid for. Instead I ended up just ordering a different product from the Bodum website for a better price, I'm excited for it to get here in a week. I'll be returning this one tomorrow.",Jessica Dooley,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de noviembre de 2021
"""Coffee"" tastes like (weak) coffee-flavored water, even when using boiling water!","2,0 de 5 estrellas","I have to drink acid-free coffee @ home or on the road. I have a travel coffee maker for when I drive, but needed a smaller, compact one when I fly. Unfortunately, this one does NOT work! l tried it using both warm & boiling water, & all you get is weak coffee-flavored water! The problem I see is that drip coffee makers ""drip"" the water thru the grounds, & so the water has plenty of time to absorb the coffee. When you pour this much water into the coffee @ one time, there's no way that the water can absorb the same amount of coffee, so that's why it's weak.",Chris Jung,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de julio de 2021

A poor tasting pour.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","The product is as advertised, but the actual coffee produced is weak and not flavourful. If you like body and flavour to your coffee, then cannot recommend getting this.

I used the same brand of coffee and prepared it with 4 different methods: French press, mocha pot, percolator, and this pour over coffee maker. the mocha pot makes really strong, concentrated espresso. the percolator and French press both make nice, well-rounded brews that are bold but not too strong.

This pour over coffee maker brews extremely weak coffee though. the beans and the water simply do not come into contact with one another for long enough.

For reference I used 2 Tbs of a finely ground coffee (Brazilian Pilao, Extraforte) per 6oz of water for each method.",Jamie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de agosto de 2020
Quite small and not particularly easy to use,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This item is small. For the amount of mess and process that goes into it, the results are less than pleasing. I had hoped this would be a good alternative to my french press (since that is such a pain to clean and reset), but it wasn't. Also, the coffee doesn't taste anywhere near as good as with a french press. I've researched and tried a couple different ways, just not the same coffee taste. It is not particularly easy to use and certainly not easier than a french press.

However, I will say it's a rather cool looking item to have sitting on my kitchen counter - that is what it has become, basically a decorative piece. I do like the look of it.",Anthony P,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de octubre de 2020

Dekorative Kanne für scheußlichen Kaffee,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Also erstmal kam das Produkt adäquat gesichert an und machte einen recht dekorativen Eindruck. Die Kanne war für den Preis auch vernünftig verarbeitet. Selbiges kann ich vom Filter leider nicht behaupten. Er war einerseits aus dem billigsten Plastik gefertigt. Lieber Hersteller, dieses Plastik kommt regelmäßig mit heißem Wasser in Kontakt, d.h. es werden sämtliche Zusätze langsam gelöst und dem Kunden in den Kaffee gekippt. Mhm, lecker!

Der Filter ist zudem zu grobporig, d.h. das Wasser läuft zu schnell durch, um das Kaffeepulver vernünftig zu extrahieren. Nach einem Schluck der Plörre aus zu viel Weichmacher und zu viel zu wenig Kaffee hat das Teil seinen Rückweg angetreten. Schade vor allem deshalb, weil ich meine zuvor gute Meinung zum Hersteller jetzt deutlich revidieren musste.",tilliboy,Revisado en Alemania el 23 de marzo de 2021
The metal mesh filter is a joke,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I am a coffee snob and I know my coffee grinds. I did indeed put ""filter grind"" coffee in the included mesh filter. I tried it twice and it tastes like granular mud. Come on no matter what your grind you are going to have residual powder from the beans which will always go through the holes in the mesh filter. I'm back to using paper filters and a plastic support holder. I'm still using the Bodum carafe. However it's hard to empty as you have to tip it 180' upside down to get every bit of coffee (and rinse) out of it.",Scott,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de abril de 2021

Molto deluso,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Bel design, buoni i materiali. Il grande problema è il filtro che lascia passare parte del caffè macinato, quindi il caffè risulta con del residuo al suo interno davvero fastidioso.
Il filtro essendo metallico lascia passare gli oli essenziali del caffè, la bevanda risultante è molto simile a quella che si ottiene con la french Press ma quest'ultima ha il vantaggio di eliminare i residui di caffè.
Inoltre il caffè nei vari travasi si fredda in fretta.

There is a ton of sediments at the bottom of the coffee. Again, I know how to use those… I don’t grind the coffee in small powder. It feels like you should grind at all so you don’t get stuff at the bottom.

Seems not like a big deal but it gets annoying when you have to do that every morning.,Max Kuznetsov,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de abril de 2021

"Schoener alternativer Kaffeebereiter, aber ganz zufrieden bin ich nicht …","3,0 de 5 estrellas","Werksseitig eher für die Ausstellung im Laden verpackt, sichert Amazon die Kanne als dicke Kugel in Blasenfolie. Nichts war beschädigt.

Das Set besteht aus der Kanne, 2 Korkmanschetten, einem Lederband mit Kordel, dem Kaffeesiebeinsatz, einem Messlöffel, einem Stopfen als “Deckel“ und einer gut verständlichen mehrsprachigen Anleitung.
.
.
Der Kaffeebereiter macht optisch einen schönen hochwertigen Eindruck. Die Verarbeitung von Kanne, Sieb und Zubehör ist sehr gut.

Das Permanent-Kaffeesieb besteht aus einem feinen Metalldraht, nicht aus fein gelochtem Blech in dem immer die Abwaschbürste hängen bleibt. Vorteil auch von diesem Sieb, der Kaffee löst sich fast rückstandslos in den Mülleimer.

Die Kanne ist recht klein, gerade mal 14cm hoch. Vier Tassen bezieht sich auf 125ml/Tasse, also die kleinen Kaffeetasten. Bei uns sind es Becher, ausgemessen hat einer unserer Kaffee“bechertassen“ 250ml.
So gesehen eine ein max. zwei Personen Kanne.

Für eine halbe Kanne braucht man etwas mehr als 2 Messlöffel Kaffee. Diese laufen schneller durch, daher eine höhere Kaffeemenge.

Die volle Kanne 0,5l benötigt weniger Kaffee, auch dauert das durchlaufen gefühlt ewig.
Man muss experimentieren bis es schmeckt.

Ausgießen lässt sich der Kaffee sehr gut und tropffrei, ein bisschen Rest bleibt in der Kanne bzw. man muss sie sonst fast völlig über Kopf halten.

Als Teekanne eignet sie sich meiner Ansicht nach auch. Bodum sollte dazu einen Deckel für die obere Öffnung beilegen.

Der Kaffee schmeckt deutlich besser als aus einer herkömmlichen Kaffeemaschine und ist zumindest bei nur einer halben Kanne (1-2 Tassen) schnell und umweltfreundlich zubereitet.
Unser Vollautomat-Kaffee schmeckt uns noch besser, aber das kann man schon von der Zubereitungsart her nicht vergleichen.

So gesehen ein schöner alternativ wirkende Kaffeebereiter, der eine oder andere Kritikpunkt fand sich aber.
.
.
• Die Bereitung von einer vollen Kanne dauert, wie gesagt, recht lange, da der Filter recht voll mit Kaffeemehl sein muss und man nur “löffelweise“ Wasser nachschenken kann.
Ideal ist sie für einen Becher = 0,25l.

• Ein bisschen “Mulsche“ bleibt in der Kanne bzw. in der Tasse. Papierfilter kriegen das ohne Reste hin.

• Es ist natürlich nicht zu verhindern, dass ein Tropfen außen an der Kanne herunterläuft oder Kaffee sonst an den Kork gerät.
Diese Flecken bleiben, auch wenn sie etwas abwaschbar sind, auf Dauer unschön sichtbar.

Fazit:
Schöner, recht alternativ wirkender Kaffeebereiter. Der Kork sieht aber schnell schmuddelig aus.",von a.B.,Revisado en Alemania el 26 de noviembre de 2016
Schönes Design,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Das Design des Kaffeebereiters ist sehr schön und fast schon ein richtiger Hinkucker.
Das ist aber auch so ziemlich das einzige das Punkte verdient.
Zum bereiten von einem halben Liter Kaffee (= 2 Becher) braucht man sehr lange. Dafür scheint der Kaffeebereiter aber anscheinend nicht ausgelegt zu sein. Denn für einen halben Liter Kaffee reicht der Permanentfilter nicht aus.
Laut Bedienungsanleitung soll 1 Kaffeelot (7 Gramm) pro Tasse (125 ml) in den Filter gegeben werden. Damit wäre der Filter schon voll bis oben hin. Geht also nicht. Mit der Hälfte an Kaffeemehl ist der Filter schon so voll das das Wasser nur Schluckweise zugegeben werden kann. Bis den der erste Becher durchgelaufen ist, hat er gerade noch Trinktemperatur.
Mit dem Kauf einer gewöhnlichen Kaffeekanne und einem Permanentfilter kommt man kostengünstiger davon und kann schneller mehr Kaffee zubereiten. Um effektiv einen halben Liter Kaffee zu kochen müsste man sich einen entsprechend großen Aufsatzfilter kaufenn was wohl nicht im Sinne des Erfinders sein dürfte
Für mich also eher ein teures Spielzeug als ein ernstzunehmender Kaffeebereiter, für den gelegentlichen ""Eintassentrinker"" aber womöglich ein stylisches Accesoire.",Tino Ehrhart,Revisado en Alemania el 4 de diciembre de 2016
"Optisch einfach wow, aber bei der Kaffeebereitung kann sie mich nicht ganz überzeugen","3,0 de 5 estrellas","Dieser Pour Over Kaffeebereiter von Bodum gefällt mir optisch wirklich gut, gerade durch die abnehmbare Manschette aus Kork und das festziehbare Lederband um den Glashals wirkt der Kaffeebereiter unglaublich schick. Als weiteres Zubehör kommt ein kleiner Dosierlöffel aus Plastik, das Filtersieb und ein kleines Deckelchen mit.

Nun gibt man sein Kaffeepulver ohne Filter in das kleine Sieb und gießt langsam heißes (aber nicht kochendes) Wasser über das Pulver, dieses läuft langsam in die Kanne. Durch die Korkmanschette lässt sich der kleine Bereiter dann auch sehr gut halten. Am Anfang muss man etwas experimentieren, mein erster Kaffee lief einfach schnell durch und war sehr wässirg, mit anderem Pulver und in anderer Menge lief es dann langsamer und damit bekam ich auch einen etwas vollmundigeren Kaffee.

Insgesamt eignet sich der Bereiter prima für ein gemütliches Früchstück mit zwei Tassen Kaffee. Je nach Mahlgrad landet auch etwas Kaffee unten im Glas, allerdings in vertretbarer Menge. Insgesamt schmeckt uns der frisch gebrühte Kaffee einfach immer recht gut und wir greifen daher gerne darauf zurück.",Ladybug,Revisado en Alemania el 3 de diciembre de 2016
En depannage,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Si vous cherchez une cafetière pour un usage quotidien... je ne suis pas sûre que ce ""Pour Over"" de Bodum fasse parfaitement l'affaire.
Connaissant la qualité des produits de cette marque et en possédant plusieurs, j'avoue avoir été déçue par celui ci.
Trop de points négatifs viennent parasiter les quelques points positifs (design, faible encombrement...)
Tout d'abord, et même si cela est sans doute ""la faute à pas de chance"", si je suis légèrement coupé la main en lavant cet article avant sa première utilisation. Un petit morceau ""en trop"" sur le dessus de l'élément en verre s'est détaché pour se planter dans ma paume. Pas très grave en soi, mais pas de bon augure...! Ensuite, la partie en liège... : je pense que si je devais m'en servir au quotidien, enlever et remettre les deux éléments en liège retenus par le cordon en cuir plusieurs fois par jours me lasserai rapidement... de plus, les éléments en liège à moins d'être très soigneux, ne pourront que s'abimer ou se tâcher avec le temps et par conséquent, considérablement détériorer l'aspect élégant de cette cafetière.
Enfin, et ce n'est pas neutre, je ne la trouve ni très pratique lorsque l'on fait plus d'une tasse (il faut alors mettre l'eau en deux fois pour éviter que cela déborde du filtre) ni très performante. En effet, le filtre, même s'il présente l'intérêt d'être permanent, n'est pas très efficace et laisse passer un peu du café moulu (industriellement ou chez un torrrefacteur) ce qui fait que l'on a inévitablement un peu de marc au fond de sa tasse... (à moins de le doubler par un filtre papier !)
En conclusion, je dirai qu'en dehors de son design, cette cafetière n'a rien de révolutionnaire et n'est que la descendante de celles utilisées par nos grands parents sans y apporter d'amélioration notable.",MAP75015,Revisado en Francia el 15 de diciembre de 2016
Leider nicht so ganz überzeugend,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Hier handelt es sich um eine kleine Ausführung für circa drei Tassen zum Schnellen aufgießen. Der Kaffee rauscht recht zügig durch den Dauerfilter und wird somit recht dünn. Man sollte also mehr Löffel pro Tasse einplanen.

Der Kaffeesatz, der sich in der Glaskanne etwas ansammelt, bleibt aufgrund des Bauches am Boden. Hier würde ich zu grob gemahlener Kaffee raten, normaler, fein gemahlener Kaffee fließt ein wenig durch den Filter.
Das Ausspülen der Kanne und des Filters ist ebenfalls etwas umständlich.

Ich persönlich muss hier anfügen, dass mich die Bodum French Press aus Glas mehr überzeugen. Auch hier sollte man grundsätzlich grob gemahlenen Kaffee verwenden, allerdings schmeckt der Kaffee kräftiger und der Satz bleibt am Boden.",Stefan Schulz,Revisado en Alemania el 31 de diciembre de 2016

Bonne petite cafetière pour petit buveur de café,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Cette petite cafetière en forme de ballon est fournie avec une ceinture en liège tenue par un lacet en cuir, une cuillère à café Bodum, un filtre à mailles permanent, un capuchon et une notice d'utilisation.

On place le filtre, on met 1 à 4 cuillère de café (maximum 4 pour 3 tasses) et on verse l'eau chaude sur le café en circulaire.

Une fois le café passé, on enlève le filtre, on place le capuchon, il a une ouverture pour verser tout en gardant la chaleur et la cafetière a un bec verseur. Voilà, rien de plus simple.
C'est une petite cafetière, destinée à une personne, voir deux si chaque personne ne boit qu'une tasse. Le café se fait rapidement.

First Pour Over -er,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I’m the only person who drinks coffee at home so I figured I get rid of my janky Keurig !
I hate cleaning those things … also costs money.

Anyway, pour over coffee is a great way to get a strong cup. It does take patience. You can’t expect it to be done correctly in 5 min.
I got the 17 oz and I make one cup (8 oz) in about 15 minutes. I don’t use the metal filter.
The metal filter makes the coffee taste gross - grounds get through. I got #2 filters as suggested in previous reviews ! Make sure to pre wet the filter to deter that paper taste.

I’ll probably invest in a nice kettle that stays hot while I’m pouring for 10-15 minutes , otherwise Bodum gets the job done !",Jess M,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de julio de 2022

Finally the pour spout is terrible, the coffee does not pour nicely at all! It splashes out, and runs all down the outer glass, staining the cork outer which you would think shouldn't get touched by the coffee.

Very nice carafe and drip coffee maker,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Sturdy, compact carafe makes an excellent cup or two and is the right size for travel. The metal filter is not great however, for finer grinds as it drains slowly and allows the grit to flow into the coffee. I disagree with the negative reviews about coffee flavor. There are lots of factors that go into making a delicious cup least of which is the type of container. I prefer a strong cup of South or Central America dark roast with a finer grind and very hot water to get the richest flavor. I use either a #2 paper filter with the metal filter or substitute a plastic Melita style filter holder with a larger portion of grounds and presto a perfectly delicious cup for my taste. Clean up is a cinch also. I know taste is subjective, but I find it much better than the Chemex which tastes fair at best.

The only gripe I have with it is the mesh strainer; it works far too fast and you end up with weak coffee. To fix this I simply bought some Melitta paper cones and these work great. I have also tried the chemex paper cones and they work fine but I find them expensive and a little too big. The cork handle not only looks nice but is easy to hold and comes off easily for washing (spot wash the cork don't dunk it in water as cork is super porous.)

Bought it for coffee when I travel by car,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this along with a small 0.5 liter Bodum electric kettle to make coffee when I am on road trips. You can never find a decent cup of coffee in a hotel, and so my days always start with a search for a coffee house that can make a good pour over. This carafe and the kettle are a perfect match. My only complaint is that in hotels, I find it hard to dispose of the coffee grounds and wash up, in the bathroom sink. With a paper filter I can simply toss the filter and grounds into the trash and then easily wash the carafe and mesh filter. I wish they would add a paper filter holder. I have found that I can put a #4 filter in the supplied stainless steel mesh filter. The #4 filter is too large, but it works. I may investigate some #2 filters to see if they fit. At least I can get a decent cup in my hotel room now! It would be even better if I wasn't double filtering it.

Nice carafe,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this coffee maker for days when I want more than one cup, and to see if it was something I could take camping in my RV. When it arrived, I struggled to get the scoop out of the carafe. It was in the bottom and took me 15 minutes and a number of different tools to get it out.

Brewing was easy but disappointing. So much sediment flowed through the filter that the bottom of the coffee cup looked like the Mississippi delta. You need to use a paper filter. While the design is nice, it’s also difficult to clean unless you have the right brush or sponge that can reach into the bottom section.

It may not sound like it but I really do like this item. Not as a coffee maker but as a carafe. I found a different mesh filter that does a much better job but I like the size and shape of the carafe and will find the right sponge to clean it.",Tdr,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de septiembre de 2018
Great pour over for a large cup of coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Here’s the deal. If you are looking for a modestly priced pour over with a nice glass container and cork hand pad for a large (16oz cup) of coffee, this is a good one to buy. I would give it a 5 but agree if you want to use a medium fine grind of coffee, you will need to use a paper filter or you will have grounds in bottom of the cup decanter which will end up in your cup. If Bodum made a mesh filter all steel with finer screen this would be a 5 all the way by most reviewers.",Wishy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de agosto de 2021
Love this pour over coffee maker,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this coffee maker in December. I love the flavor from this style of brewer as it is less bitter. It is very easy to use and clean. I read a several complaints about the cork getting wet when cleaning. It does but it drys out with no apparent damage. One said it did not have a molded pour spout, mine does. As to complaints about grounds in the coffee, I do not have that problem as I use a biodegradable paper filter with the mesh filter which makes clean up a breeze. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 as I can not speak to issues with the filter.",cynthia s,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de febrero de 2021

Love love love,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I am always been a fan of Bodum products and this one does not disappoint. I bought the 17 ounce size as this is perfect for my first brew of the day. It makes a wonderful flavored coffee, full bodied and robust. I am so very happy with this particular product. It is the perfect size. Clean up is easy. Even though it comes with its own stainless mesh filter, I have just ordered the paper filters to go inside of it for easier cleanup. Coffee is ready in no time. Love love love.

The only drawback to this is that by the time the hot water goes through the filter and you allow enough time, the coffee itself is lukewarm.",Marva Mason,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de septiembre de 2020

Cute and brews a great cup!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",I bought this to try after I broke my french press. I loved the richness of the coffee brewed with my press and was worried this wouldn't be quite as nice. I was shocked at how easy to brew this was and how wonderful the coffee was. The metal filter still gives you all of the oils that you lose with a paper filter. The design is thoughtful and it a wonderful way to brew. I have since replaced my french press but this remains my favorite way to brew. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to step up their coffee game at home or as a gift for any coffee lover.,lknight87,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de diciembre de 2020

Delivers weak coffee due to quick filter drain,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",I really wish I could give this product a 5 star and I would but the only issue I have with it is that the pour (water) drains way to quickly through the filter because the holes are too big. A pour over should be a slow process. When the hot water drains too quickly then you just end up getting a weak cup of coffee and also wasting your grinds. The paper filters work much better than the re-usable filter that it comes with. But it is a very nice design. Perfect for 2 cups of coffee. You can always double up on the filtering process by placing a paper filter in the filter that it comes with. But make sure you purchase the 1 cup cone shaped paper filters since this unit is generally for a single serving.,elizny,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de diciembre de 2019

The only reason I knocked off a star (and if I had the option, I would have only taken off a half star) is because it is very fragile. When you wash this carafe, you have to be extra careful of what dishes are near it. I have stainless steel silverware and after the carafe got tapped with a fork, the bottom cracked.

My first ever Pour Over Coffee Pot & I absolutely ***LOVE*** it!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Play Video
I’ve been wanting a part of a coffee maker for a while now. Finally decided to purchase one for my birthday and so glad I decided on this one. I went back-and-forth here on Amazon searching for the best pour over coffee maker, comparing all the reviews and this one had the best of everything. Just made my 1st cup of coffee, it’s absolutely delicious and I just had to write a review immediately afterward. The Bodum Pour Over CoffeePot is stylish, sturdy, comfortable to hold when hot and cold and it’s super easy to take apart and clean. I had two videos to upload but Amazon only allows one, so trying to include as much info as possible. I used 12oz of water and 2.5 level scoops of coffee for my xl coffee cup. I would suggest grinding your own beans if you have a coffee grinder. I use the prepackaged Gevalia Papua New Guinea coffee which is a fine ground. Took about 5-6 min to brew. Side noting that the coffee will not be too hot by the time brewing has completed due to the length of time it takes for fine grounds to brew. A slightly larger ground coffee bean would work best and would be hotter when finished. I add milk to my coffee, so that does tend to cook it down slightly also. Overall, I’m extremely pleased with this pot and the delicious cup of coffee it produced.

Comparing my experience to the other reviewer’s, the Glass is sturdy, it’s not thin at all, so as long as you don’t manhandle it roughly, you should be just fine. The cork is very comfortable in your hand, protecting your hand from the heat of the coffee and it is NOT hot at all to hold. It comes apart easily, simply squeeze the button, gently loosen the leather strap, and it slides right over. The cork pops right off, wash with soapy hot water and dry. Cork pops right back on and stays in place while you use two hands to replace the leather strap and re-tighten in place. Love this pour over coffeepot and highly recommend it. Don’t hesitate, it’s perfect! Two thumbs up!",Vanessa C.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de mayo de 2022
"Love it, functional and adorable I've had it a year","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I decided to leave a review when I was trying to show this product to a friend, I've had mine over a year now and it's working out great. No problems with the filter which works perfectly, the court fits perfectly if you just turn it slightly. The first time I put it back on I had that feeling it didn't fit properly but instead of going and leaving a bad review I just tried fitting it right side up instead of upside down or turning it slightly in voila, it fit. It's never broken and I do put it in the dishwasher I'm sorry but if you've been using a glass coffee decanter thingy for a month and suddenly it leaks your coffee, you just broke it. You can't blame the glass for that! And to say in your review that you were replacing your last one which you also broke? I think you need to invest in some Pyrex just find something that your filter will fit on top of it's not rocket science, it's just coffee. Yes, I realize some of them might be a different quality than others of them but what do you expect for this inexpensive price? I spent $25 something I think when I bought mine and I see they are about $14 now so pretty affordable either way.

4 stars for desing - I bought the 17 oz one because I think it looks the best (nice and cute). The corck around the waist could be a little bit thinner I think, but other than that I love it. Note, that this size is good for 2 (size tall in sbucks terms) cups of coffee. You can get away with three, but you'll be labeled stingy.
5 stars brewing - It comes with a filter basket which has thus far been excellent at making sure no debris comes into the coffee (just a trace of soot). It even comes with a little cap that you can put on it after brewing so that the coffee can remain hot for a little while longer.
5 for taste - I'm not coffee nut, but as far as tastes goes, it definately produces a great tasting cup IMO. I've never gotten bitter coffee out of it (even when using weeks old, stale, store bought preground beans lol). When I use quality/fresh beans, the output is sublime (better than the moka pot).

I dont find there is a significant difference between this and an automated drip machine, but, I find this to be a great way to avoid dedicating a portion of counter space to bulky machines while at the same time produce great coffee!",Omar,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de agosto de 2020
Awesome coffee!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I was looking into a more affordable and smaller version of a Chemex-style coffee maker, because I love how pour-over coffee tastes. I've used a french press for years, and using the Bodum pour-over coffee maker wasn't too far off from how I usually make my coffee. I love that it comes with a metal/mesh filter, because I don't have to buy a specific kind of filter, and it is zero waste.

I start by heating my water (we use reverse osmosis water) to around 200 - 205 degree F. If you don't have a thermometer, just heat to boil, then turn off heat and wait a few minutes. Then, I weigh out 25 grams of medium-coarse coffee which I grind fresh in a manual burr grinder (do not use a mechanical grinder! It creates heat in grounds and also does not grind it evenly). If you don't have a kitchen scale, this ends up being around 2.5-3 tablespoons.

Next, I use about 15 g of water for every 1 g of ground coffee. This ends up being 375 g hot water for 25 g of coffee. I pour over a bit of hot water over all the grounds to ""bloom"" the coffee, then begin pouring over the rest of the 375 g of water (I do this with the coffee maker sitting on my kitchen scale to measure).

Once the water has passed through (should take around 3 minutes), the coffee is ready! It takes a bit more effort than french press, but I love how it turns out.

I love the size of this maker, since I am the only one who drinks coffee in my apartment and do not heed a huge capacity.",Elise,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de abril de 2020
One of the best things I've ever bought,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My only complaint about this coffee maker is that Bodum doesn't sell replacement carafes by themselves. I shattered mine finally after 6 years or something (it had already survived a couple drops; this was a particularly stupid move on my part) and I asked on their website if I could get the carafe alone (they sell other spare parts). Ended up having to buy new but that's OK because it really is one of the best things I've ever bought. It takes up no more room than a side plate and it makes tasty coffee. If you make the coffee too weak, pour it through twice -- elegance.",Esther,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de mayo de 2023
"If you like your brew strong, add a paper filter","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I needed to replace my drip coffee maker after 10 years of daily use. I loved my French press before the children broke it and almost bought another until I saw this and decided to give it a go. I’m the only coffee drinker in the house so the 2 (American size) cups it brews is perfect but it may pose a problem for those with 2+ coffee drinkers as it doesn’t hold enough water as a 12 cup pot.

I have used it twice so far and just got it yesterday. The first cups I brewed were intended to be mild. I got home from work, brewed the coffee, put the chickens up and poured my mug. The first thing I noticed is that without an additional filter, the coffee doesn’t “percolate” very well and you get a really mild brew. I suppose that’s fine for some but I like my coffee black and strong so the following morning I placed two paper filters into the reusable mesh filter and it helped tremendously.

I don’t care for the keurig type coffee makers (I’ve tried them twice, each only lasting a few weeks) and don’t like leaving appliances on the counters. Big, bulky brewing systems take up a lot of cabinet space but this can go into the mug cupboard without hogging room. It’s cute to boot.",TexasJess,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de mayo de 2020
Where have you been all my life?,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","What was I waiting for??? In my search for a tasty at-home cup of coffee, I now am the owner of a Flex-Brew k-cup/carafe coffee maker, a single cup grind and brew, a full carafe grind and brew, 2 mocha pots, a stovetop percolator, party sized percolator, a french press, a one-touch pod-based cappuccino/espresso maker (two if you count the one at work) and a superautomatic espresso maker.

Had I known I could make the most amazing cup of coffee from simply pouring water over the grinds, I'd have save myself a lot of money over the last several years. I don't know how I grew up never learning this.

I purchased this with a reusable hemp filter and still don't have my burr brinder and yet the flavor is perfect. I cannot wait until the burr grinder arrives.

I've you've been thinking about getting a pour-over system, I highly recommend this one as a starting point along with a handheld grinder and small stainless steel gooseneck pour as a simple and affordable way to try out pour-over coffee. You will not regret it!",scooterapd,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de enero de 2021
LOVE IT! (just remember...),"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I like this product. I've noticed some negative reviews most concerning how fragile the unit is. Yeah, it's glass - THIN GLASS. Not heavy duty so be careful. Even though I haven't fallen prey to the mistake I would be careful not to rinse with cold water right after use.
I'd only offer one concern. I use Cafe Bustello which is an espresso grind coffee. True espresso grind. By the time a full cup has dripped through you will likely have to hit it in the microwave after. Takes a while to filter this grind and you'll be left with a tepid cup when finished. Other than that, it works, coffee tastes great and it's very handy. Cleanup is so much easier and faster than a press pot I'd repurchase on that alone. I suppose a more durable model for travel would be nice but I knew what I was purchasing. It will arrive exactly as displayed, no surprises.",Stan,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de noviembre de 2021
Really good for puerh tea,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been looking for a vessel to brew puerh tea, and this is perfect.

I get puerh in the little tuo chas (solid small balls of fermented tea leaves). Those need to be soaked a bit before they will fall apart, and then they need to be rinsed in warm water before the hot water brew. All of this makes it a pain to use a dangling tea infuser, or a typical top-of-the-cup tea strainer.

I put the tuo cha loose in the bottom of this carafe, get it good and wet, and wait a while for it to fall apart (how long depends on the age of the ball). Then I carefully pour out any remaining water - the tea will stay behind in the curve of the side. I do this two more times - once to rinse, and once to brew. I use a Chemex glass lid to keep the heat in during brewing, and to save the leaves for the next brew. (I don't use the Bodum filter or lid).

This isn't what the carafe was designed for, but it works.",ring0,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de noviembre de 2019
Exactly what I wanted,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This met all my expectations. It is exactly like the photo. However, my expectations were for a single person who is not a heavy coffee drinker. I like that the cork grip is held in place by a pinch adjuster, easily removed if cleaning the bottle by dishwasher. The stainless steel filter is very easy to spray clean, although it can be cleaned by dishwasher also. Just for the heck of it, I tried the fullest brewing capacity using the stated instructions of 1 scoop per 4 oz cup and found the filtering lacking...too much grounds. I don't recommend using more than 2 scoops or 1 k-pod at a time (for 8 to 16 oz of water). That said, if you grind your own coffee, perhaps you could use a coarser grind and maybe get the 4 scoops to filter adequately, idk. For light coffee use, I am pleased with this purchase.",Teri,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de diciembre de 2021
Perfect for what I needed it for,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I don't really write review but I every using it having rad the negative ones I thought I would. To answer the negative ones... 1. It's small - yea you should know that if you read the specifications. How big do you think 17 ounces is? 2. There's plastic in the filter - yea you can see that in the pictures. Also I've never owned a coffee maker where hot liquids didn't touch plastic at some point. 3. It's hard to hold - no it isn't. I find it quite comfortable. 4. There's silt left in the carafe - this is true but it doesn't bother me since I'm used to french press. You really do need to use good coffee that's medium course with this, if you use regular fine course coffee it's gonna get kind of sludgy. Overall this is a great little coffee maker if you only want a couple cups. 10/10 would recommend.",Kindle Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de agosto de 2021
handy small coffee pot,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The item is marketed as a pour-over coffee machine. That is accurate, but I bought it because it hold exactly 16 ounces of coffee and I can adapt it to the remains of my coffee machine. The coffee machine heats the water, acting as a coffee dripper on top of my new coffee pot / pour-over machine. A little inelegant but it works great.",William Allen,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de junio de 2023
Easy to Use & Lovely Look,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I just love to start my day with making a cup of pour-over coffee. It came as shown in the picture — very easy to use, looks lovely and “economical”(good quality for $). There are two different sizes and this is the smaller one. It’s good for one person (~400-500ml). The handle prevents heat and slipperiness and mine doesn’t have any quality issues as mentioned in several other reviews. I’d say a paper filter is necessary as I used one on top of the metal filter that came with it and the coffee was clear and tasted great. I suggest to use a U-conical shaped paper filter because the bottom of the metal filter is flat and I had to fold my cone shaped filter a little. I haven’t tried to use the metal filter or my paper filter separately, will try later and see how they work individually. Btw, it’s easy to clean as well. Would recommend this!",Yifan Zhang,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de agosto de 2021
Easy to use and makes great coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Years ago I was introduced to the pour over method by an ex. After experiencing that way of making coffee I never wanted to make it another way again. It is so simple, unlike a French press, and tastes so much better than any electric coffee pots. I bought myself the smallest sized carafe and I love it. It makes the perfect amount for one person. It works great, makes wonderful coffee, and is super easy to rinse out/clean on a busy morning. I really appreciate the extra plastic piece that was included to direct the coffee flow out of the carafe - it is super handy. Highly recommend!",Marcie Blaylock,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de marzo de 2022
Best pour over coffee glass container for a fantastic cup o' joe!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Purchased this after a friend encouraged me to do so when she gave me a ground bag of coffee she did not want (she didn't like the taste). I have been super happy with this as it is super easy to clean, use, and looks cute on the kitchen counter. I hadn't had a good taste of ground coffee since the pandemic began and buying this little glass made me not miss going inside a coffee shop for a good quality cup of joe. I did received my first pour over coffee glass broken in pieces during delivery but the company was easy to get a hold of and I got a replacement within 1-2 days.",MelG,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de febrero de 2022
Great option for pour over,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I like this coffee maker because it's a small enough size to make a single serve or a little more if needed, so it's easy to store because it's not huge. 17oz is perfect, and plus, it means I won't overestimate and use too many coffee grounds. I like the small plastic scoop that comes with it, and the accompanying measuring instructions seem spot on. The cork sleeve is admittedly not as easy to use as some of the other plastic options, but it looks so much better. I removed the clasp that holds the strings in place around the sleeve, and so that I can just tie it with a knot. Much quicker than dealing with the clasp.

Additionally, what made me choose this coffee maker over several other options was the reusable filter. This is a big plus to me, because filters are extremely wasteful. Plus, this steel filter is very easy to clean, and does not let more than an average amount of sediment through.",Sophie Erstad,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de agosto de 2020
Brilliant!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Ignore the negative reviews!
This little gem is a must have. If you are someone who is impatient and you don't have a steady hand, then this is not for you! I read the reviews and as one man described so perfectly, once you have mastered the pouring process (circular motion), this coffee maker is worth the wait. And the wait is no more than 5 minutes. For those who said you need paper filters and those who said there are sediments, I seriously have to say you have clearly poured the water in too fast and missed the coffee. It's worth patting the grounded coffee a little before pouring the water over it! A definite recommendation. Thank you Bodum",RainbowPhoenix,Revisado en Reino Unido el 28 de abril de 2022
Makes 1 or 2 great cups of coffee fast!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I needed a pour over that was affordable, simple, had a large enough opening to easily clean, and I like a brand I can trust. This checks off every box. I use filters in the one it came with with which reduces sediment. I can make 1 or 2 cups of coffee, and not waste a thing. One of the best purchases I’ve made here in a while! Mine is the 17 Oz size.",IndieGurl,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de enero de 2023
I'm Impressed!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Okay so I really was not even sure about pour over coffee. Totally worth it though. So glad I bought this pour over coffee maker. You can make a medium to large cup of coffee in this. Well if your like me, that may depend on what you call a large cup of coffee. This cleans very easily. Water pours easy. Love the grip about the middle thankful for it, the glass would be too hot to hold and I looked at others that had no grip. The flavor of the coffee is in between a normal cup of coffee and an espresso. Depending in how much or strong you make your coffee. I am really impressed with this thing. I would highly reccomend you try it, and it makes a cute coffee thing on coffee cart or table.",Leah,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de abril de 2021
Two days and several cups of great coffee later....,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have had this little coffee maker for two days and I am enamored with it. It looks cool, doesn't take up much counter space, it's simple...but mostly importantly the coffee is great. I have used many pour-over brewers and french presses, but thus far this is my favorite. Why do I like it?
1. Simplicity
2. Versatility--I can brew just one cup or more, if I desire to do so
3. No need to buy filters--there is a minimal residue at the bottom of the pot, but you also get all the oils and flavors that should be in coffee
4. Filter is mostly stainless steel, minimal plastic
5. It's small--it doesn't take up counter space, which is important if you have a small kitchen
6. The coffee tastes great
7. Did I mention the coffee tastes great?
The only drawback could be the cork, in the long run. I clean it without removing it (the instructions say to remove it prior to cleaning), because I wash it by hand. The cork is in two pieces, which fall away once the leather cord is removed. So, if that sounds annoying to you, get the model with the rubber wrap.",Renee K.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de agosto de 2017
