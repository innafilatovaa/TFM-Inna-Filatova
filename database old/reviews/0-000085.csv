Careful this item melts,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","We have had this for a couple months now and the handle is not of good quality and is starting to melt.

Poorly sealed and virtually uncleanable,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Seal between upper and lower sections is terrible. The interior of the upper section has a sort of inverse dome in the bottom, such that you have progressively less space the further down the chamber you go - it's impossible to properly clean.

Better served as scrap metal. Avoid.

Edit: I tested this on a glasstop electric range in my kitchen, but I'd bought it for use with a Duxtop 9600ls induction hotplate in a workshop space. Doesn't work with the induction burner. Yes, it is a magnetic steel alloy, but it's too small to register on that particular model hotplate. I was already at 1-star before this, so I couldn't drop it further even if I wanted to. Not sure I would anyway; it's sort of a shared fault between this tiny hunk of scrap and the induction hotplate.",E Farrell,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de abril de 2023

Completely stainless steel.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I should of bought a steel one years ago. Gas and induction friendly. It works really well and coffee tastes great. Just remember to take it off the heat in time and your coffee will shine with crema rather than being bitter.
It's fully stainless steel from the base to the top. Steel filter around the seal as well as steel coffee basket.
This is what I was looking for as it is it doesn't stain over time like aluminium moka pots do. After many uses the inside of the water base doesn't blacken and corrode like aluminium and is more hygienic.",Matt,Revisado en Australia el 16 de mayo de 2022

This Easyworkz Pedro Stovetop Espresso Maker Stainless Steel Italian Coffee Machine Maker Moka Pot is replacing my old (and smaller capacity) moka pot made of aluminum. The sturdy feeling stainless steel of this stays shiny looking, even from the dishwasher, and is very easy to use, maintain and clean. I'm happy with the larger capacity, which can make 4-6 smaller espressos, or 2 larger cups of coffee. We had a blackout situation recently, and my husband and I had a nice cup using this pot on our butane camp stove.",KC,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de febrero de 2021
Makes Great Coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I like this Easyworkz Pedro very much. It makes great coffee. I wouldn't really call it espresso because there's no crema. It's really more like a stovetop percolator than a pressure-based espresso maker. But the coffee that it makes is delicious.

Setup is a bit of a bear. The instructions want you to make 3 batches of coffee and throw them out before using it for the first time. That can get a bit tedious. But I took them at their word, and figured it might help season the coffee pot. What I found to be the fastest way to do this was to remove the entire pot setup and put it into the sink when each throwaway batch was ready. Then I would run cold water over the entire coffee pot until it was cold enough to touch and work with. Between waiting for each batch to boil, then cooling down in the sink and cleaning out the old grounds, the entire initial setup took me about 1/2 an hour.

But now that I have it up and running I've used it almost everyday. I do like it. And that polished stainless finish is really beautiful.

I would say this is a close second to my favorite method of coffee brewing, which is pour over. Actually it's probably a tie. Both are very good. This might be a bit easier, but again, it's close.

It's definitely a fun and appealing addition to the kitchen.

Highly Recommended!!!","Robert Cox, NYC",Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de enero de 2021
I've wanted to try this method of making coffee for a long time!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","A couple of years ago I read an interesting article about the Italian who invented the Mokka pot to make his mother's method of making coffee easier. He advertised it so that the little pot he invented became an Italian icon. Even though I already had a couple of ways of making my morning coffee, I was tempted to try this, partly because I'm experimenting with using an induction burner rather than my regular gas stove. This very slick looking pot works on induction. Also, it's a little larger than some of the others I've seen, so you can get a couple of lattes at least from this pot, and even more tiny expressos. Although no instructions at all came with the machine, there were clear instructions on Amazon. I was tempted to give four stars because of the lack of an instruction sheet, but it was so easy to use and clean and made such good coffee, I gave five stars. Although I don't have a fancy burr grinder, I managed a very fine grind by shaking my grinder multiple times and regrinding. It was a little difficult to see the maximum water mark, and if you didn't know why the extra piece is included (to use if you want to make a smaller amount and use fewer grounds), you might have ended up with weak coffee. Luckily, the information on the Amazon product page took care of that. I added water, added coffee, put the pot together and put it on the burner, and magic (otherwise known as science) happened. I ended up with some coffee that was different than the coffee I get from my cold brewer or my French press. The flavor of the coffee was very prominent, but not bitter. I used my frother, and created a very nice latte. I didn't get a single ground in my cup, and it was easy to heat up the second cup right in the pot. Cleaning out the grounds was no more difficult than in the French press. I think this little pot may be my weekend coffee maker, since I'll have time to sit and savor the coffee and frothy milk and maybe dream I'm back in Italy.",UCA Lady,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de enero de 2021
Nice espresso maker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","There aren't directions so if you've never used one, you should google. It's a well made little machine that chugs out some nice coffee. It comes with a little extra, I wasn't sure what it was, but found that it's to keep the coffee tamped down if you're making a smaller batch of espresso, it's great, I've never had one before. You need to make sure the handle is out of the heat, I've had espresso handles melt when I wasn't paying attention. It's a nice machine and looks good on my stove.",Rowan,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de enero de 2021
Heavy duty,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have the 6.8 Oz version of this moka pot. This is my first time making coffee using a kitchen tool like this. It's fun and the coffee tastes very different. It also take some additional homework and preparation to do this correctly. I looked up ways of using this on the internet.

The pot is made out of three main sections: the bottom part, the funnel and the top part. Overall, it's made out of heavy gauge stainless steel and you can really feel the weight of this pot. It's mostly easy to wash except the reducer with the silicone gasket.

Because it doesn't have the typical filter, it doesn't filter out the typical part of the coffee grind. I can definitely taste more of the body of the coffee using this pot. It definitely takes a little bit more time compared to a K-Cup but I get a different type of satisfaction from making coffee using this.",Sandfinder,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de enero de 2021

Posso dirmi pienamente soddisfatta: è bella, sembra solida, si avvita bene e non perde acqua, non fa schizzare il caffè sui fornelli se dimentica sul fuoco, va bene sia per il gas, che per piastre elettriche o ad induzione… insomma 🔝 😃 PS ne ho comprate 2!",federica,Revisado en Italia el 10 de junio de 2024
