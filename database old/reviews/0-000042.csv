perfect brew,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",I love my AeroPress and this flow control filter is a game changer as it would always drip while brewing and now it doesn't drip through until I'm ready to press it!

Excellent addition!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been using the original cap with a reusable mesh screen for a while and I didn't have many concerns. Yes, if you tried inverted, it leaked a little, but it wasn't terrible. It still made damn good coffee! One thing that it lacked was the ability to make a decent espresso like coffee with perfect crema. Not anymore. 18 grams of espresso roast Sumatra Mandheling (thank you, Smokin' Beans), 60ml of boiling hot water, stir for 30 seconds, and press. It's a thing of beauty!",Eric Zachareas,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de julio de 2024
"Expensive, Limited utility","3,0 de 5 estrellas","There are at least 2 Alternatives to this flow control cap that are less expensive.

I love my aeropress set ups and make a variety of coffee styles with them. The flow control cap was purchased to make espresso style coffee and the results from that experiment were disappointing. It is hard to install and remove the cap and the pressure didn’t really do much to simulate espresso. I will continue to use the inverted brewing method to get extraction without drip through.
I do really love aeropress for making coffee in different styles with easy clean up but the flow control cap was a pain to use and expands the difficulty in clean up",Appalachian Engineer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de julio de 2024

Now I can brew right into my travel mug,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I have a carefully selected lineup of travel mugs, and the Aeropress doesn't fit over any of them, so I was always having to brew into some other cup, then pour from that cup into my travel mug. Now I can brew delicious coffee right into my travel mug with ease. I recommend pairing this with the Aeropress metal filter for oh so tasty full bodied coffee.

Update: the flow control does leak. It's not a problem if the flow control fits into the cup you're brewing into, then it leaks into the cup. It does make delicious coffee.",catsndogs,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de julio de 2024

Did not fit Aeropress Go; had to shave off some plastic at 4 places,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This is the third filter cap I've bought over the years that would not turn to tighten at the bottom of the plunger. (The four protrusions on the cap would not turn in the track of the tube.) The first filter cap was the standard type, and I returned it; the last two, I had to file off some of the plastic so the filter cap would turn and tighten at the bottom of the plunger. Why is this a recurring issue? --even with this flow control filter cap? I do like the non-drip, flow control feature -- just wish the cap would fit right out of the box like it should.",Todd Nelson,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de junio de 2024
Great for making iced coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",To make iced coffee with an Aero Press you need to let the water sit in the grounds for at least five minutes.

Works great,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I was wrong in my original review. I switched from my third party metal filter to the aeropress metal filter and the leaking stopped. This works as advertised and very well.

Original Review:
I used this on a standard aeropress with metal filter. After screwing into place and before even finishing turning over it was already leaking through the sides. Pressing the stopper made the situation worse. No amount of loosening or tightening helped. It's a good thing I was next the sink or my counter would have been drowning in coffee.",Timothy G Melton,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de junio de 2024

Disappointing,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",Fits very poorly onto the Aeropress (too tight) and doesn’t really make any difference to the taste compared to the standard filter,Stiperstones,Revisado en Reino Unido el 7 de junio de 2024
Works great!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Since I started using this, my aeropress does not leak like it used to. It works great. Definitely recommend this product",Byron P.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de junio de 2024
This should be standard equipment for the areopress,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This absolutely changed my opinion on the areopress. Since this is a product made by the company themselves it fits just right and let's me actually steep the coffee.

It accepts paper and metal filters. Requires little to no cleaning. Holds water in the maker, allowing me to steep the coffee and improve the flavor.

Before I received this, half my coffee would already be in my cup before I went to press. This could not only leave a mess, but it would only really flavor half my water.

All that said, it is kind of expensive for something that probably should have come with the areopress in the first place. The fact they they tell you to not invert the product while steeping tells you that this new lid designed to prevent leak-through is a failing on the original lids design IMO. One other smaller issue is that the new lid seals very tightly. When you put the plunger in after pouring in the water, you can press out coffee if you're too heavy handed because of how tight the seal is.",Gustave,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de junio de 2024

Don’t use it with paper or a lot of pressure. This thing made a mess of our kitchen in seconds.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This thing focuses all the pressure on a single point, blowing straight through the paper filters and shooting coffee out of the sides. Use ONLY with metal filters, and even then I found the flavor of the coffee to be generally worse than a paper + metal filter in the standard end cap.",J R,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de mayo de 2024
Does what it is supposed to,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I didn't like how much the basic Aeropress dripped while pouring in initial water and made me feel very rushed to get the pour done and get the plunger in so that the vacuum stopped the dripping for the duration of the brew period. Made doing exact weighed pours or any kind of 'blooming' difficult to impossible.

The flow control cap lets me to use the equivalent of all the 'inverted method' brewing techniques but without the additional spill/burn risk and hassle of actually having to balance on the plunger and flip over. Could not be easier to use.

A little expensive for what amounts to a plastic cap and valve...but does what it says.",Marie Carrion,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de mayo de 2024

A must have!!!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Makes a huge difference to the taste and most of all makes it alot easier to use, I was previously using the upside down method to brew but now it can be used the correct way so no spills and no dripping once you are finished draining the aeropress. Pull the plunger back a little before you removed the cap to empty it that way the paper filters don't get stuck. If only the aeropress came with this cap to begin with!!!!!",Tom graham,Revisado en Reino Unido el 19 de mayo de 2024
Clogs very easily.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","My aeropress is probably 10 or so years old and we have used it every day, until we lost the original cap. This cap has caused us all kinds of problems. If something is not perfectly aligned, the grounds get under the filter and plug the hole. When that happens you have to dump everything out and try again. We have been using a V60 in that case. I was told by Aeropress that this doesn't perfectly fit my old model, so I'd need to purchase a new Aeropress to make it fit properly. Quite a disappointment and we're out of the return window. This doesn't happen all the time and I'm a person who tries to figure things out - what's the problem, what causes it, etc. It doesn't take much for this thing to cause issues and start my day off poorly. Disappointing for sure.",Lisa Persichetti,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de mayo de 2024
"Super easy, clean, and great flavor","5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is the way.

As most other reviewers stated, this should have been included with the Aeropress from the start, no drips, no need to invert, and a nice foam (not crema). It stings to have to pay $35 for this but pay it once and enjoy the Aeropress much more - that affected my ""value for money"" rating...

Lovely espresso style coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Be sure to check the Aeropress website for instructions. It's different than the standard process. Use boiling temp water, brew for minute, plunge gently (this isn't actually espresso so relax), and you will have fantastic results. Most of the problems people have is from pressing too hard. No leaking at all. Wonderful flavor, more than the normal aeropress. And the crema is from aeration. Yes, you can use fine espresso ground coffee in this thing with delicious results. If grinding beans yourself, go a few clicks finer than the standard aeropress.

The mixed reviews discouraged me from getting this sooner. I love it. Despite this not being an apples to apples comparison, I will say this makes much better coffee than cheap home espresso machines.",Abe Thomas,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de mayo de 2024

It works!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Removes the early leakage of coffee upon pouring water by standard method. The inverted method would render this device unnecessary but if you want to use the AeroPress the normal way with time to stir the grounds prior to the extraction press, then this device is for you.

A Genius addon to a Genius coffee maker.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used an aeropress for around a decade now and tried tools like steel filters but still had issues with coffee grains getting into my coffee when using inverted method, and of course the dreaded drip with the classic method.
This little invention should become the new standard normal cap for any aeropress user. Eliminates the need for inverted method brewing entirely, increases pressure substantially without making the press more difficult, and can still be paired with steel filters for what is the closest to an espresso style that an Aeropress is capable of (still nowhere near actual 8 bars, but closer to the mark than other options without feeling like you're going to break your cup with pressing force).
Just fantastic. Buy it.",Bryan Crabtree,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de abril de 2024
Great addition,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",I really like this. Other reviews said it didnt fit correctly into the main body. But mine fits great and is easy to take off. Makes great coffee but no where near an espresso type of coffee. I use it daily.,Josh,Revisado en Canadá el 27 de abril de 2024
Love it!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",Gives you more control over your brew!,Ray Ace,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de abril de 2024
Reduces variables of making consistent coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","If you’re someone that weighs your beans and water, and uses an Aeropress, then definitely buy this device. Using the aeropress standard filter cap, the water begins to flow through the filter immediately, and although placing the plunger on top stops the flow, it’s an unknown variable of water quantity that flows through the filter before stopping the flow with the plunger. This improved filter cap keeps the entire amount of water mixed with the grounds until the specified time, before using the plunger. And it easier and safer than inverting the aeropress.

One issue, when you tap out the used filter, be sure the rubber round gasket doesn’t pop out in the trash or sink. It won’t work without it.

I highly recommend this product. I would like Aeropress to sell a slightly more expensive aeropress option with this filter cap, because this filter cap is a bit pricey, and the stock filter cap is no longer needed. But until that ever happens, this is a required purchase.",Dee,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de abril de 2024

Better than the stock filter cap,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",This filter cap is much better than the stock filter cap that the aero press comes with. I somehow lost mine. I must have accidentally thrown it in the trash. I ordered this one and it's great.

Works with metal or paper filters,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this to use with paper filters, since I like them better than the metal ones. That said, paper filters are more ""fiddly"" to use, and I've ripped a couple, putting grounds in my coffee. Still, this device keeps weak coffee from dripping into my cup before I'm ready to press.

I went to make coffee one morning did the exact same ritual I’ve done for years same water temp same pressure on plunger same coffee. The only difference was the aeropress cap that I recently bought. Except this morning the cap blew up on me so scolding hot water blasted my stomach and the other half of the cup plastered my walls. Burns are so bad I’ve actually going to the doctor tomorrow. And now I have to pay someone to paint my walls white again.

AeroPress Flow Control Filter Cap is a Game Changer,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",I have been using AeroPress for years and prefer it over all the other methods of coffee making I have tried. The addition of the Filter Cap that holds the coffee until it sits for a while before expressing it makes a huge difference in flavor. The richness and fullness of the coffee along with a nice crema is excellent because of the flow control filter cap.,Robert Duvall Smith,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de abril de 2024
Perfect Compliment,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I like very strong coffee. My favorite blend comes in medium grind. With the original cap, the water drips too fast, almost becoming a pour over. And not strong enough for my taste. With this cap, I literally place the AeroPress with coffee and filter on my Keurig, and 10 ounces of hot water drips directly into the AeroPress. No drip whatever. I then place the AeroPress on my cup, stir and let it steep for about four minutes. The pressing process is easier than with the original cap, and I get my perfect--strong--cup.

Recommended for best Aeropress results,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This cap is tiers better than the original. It allows longer coffee immersion times, almost no leakage, and better plunger control. The cap should come with the Aeropress or be part of a premium package. It’s an immediate upgrade and recommended purchase for frequent Aeropress users.

Pros:
* Little to no leakage; producing fuller and less astringent results.
* The ability to immerse the grinds for longer without the use of the inverted method.
* Plunger presses are easier and more controlled.

Cons:
* Requires slightly more cleaning time compared to the original cap.
* Slight leaking can happen at the walls if the plunger is pressed too firmly. This can be avoided by using less force. There will not be a lot of leaking regardless.

* Note: The competing Fellow Prismo cap will produce similar results with less leakage. However, it requires a special metal filter.

"No need to invert anymore, makes Espresso-like coffee and foam.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","This review is specifically for the Aeropress flow control Filter cap.

The biggest caveat is that this does not come with a metal filter like the Fellow Prismo does. Had I known that, I might have considered the third party product instead, given how competitive the prices are for what you get. However, I have heard of third party metal filters warping the aeropress in order to use it properly. I assume you get the peace of mind that this will not warp your product, by itself of when used with Aerobie's own metal filter.

Build quality feels reasonable, although it can flex if you squeeze it right. It has a nice grippy texture along the edge that makes it easy to unscrew, and plenty of surface area to grip it for installing and removing it. Compared to the filter cap that comes with the Aeropress, it's much easier to install and remove. I don't have any trouble gripping it even when the cap is wet, although it is much taller and wont fit inside the Aeropress Go's case.

I tested it with an off-the-shelf dark roast coffee, finely ground in my cheapo 40 dollar cuisinart grinder, and just enough 200 degree water to make the grounds stir-able, steeped for one minute and pressed with reasonable effort. It produced a nice concentrated espresso-like drink with a significantly larger layer of foam compared to similar efforts with the stock cap. The flavor seemed different too, and in a way that I liked. I understand the aeropress and similar manuals cannot produce a true espresso, but it can make a nice substitute in my opinion.

Ive been brewing with this cap regularly in my Aeropress go, sometimes for espresso-like concentrates, but often larger servings as well. I typically prefer the ""inverted method"" (even though it doesn't affect the coffee, its just the process I like), but this cap generally stops water from leaking out early. I can use the Aeropress as intended (reducing spills, water burns, or wasted coffee), and squeeze more water into the chamber since I'm not worrying about keeping the plunger well-seated for a flip.

UPDATE: Had some leaking issues with the cap and figured it was just user error or something. I recently found out Aerobie revised the design with a rubber gasket over this issue, and they sent me the revised model at no charge when I told them I was having leaking issues. It's still not perfect, though the revised version works MUCH better. Having used the flow control cap for a year and Aeropress coffeemakers for much longer, this is easily the best accessory for the product. I just wish the price was competitive with the Fellow Prismo kit.",Imatron,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de julio de 2023

"Good solution, 5x price.","3,0 de 5 estrellas","Yes it works well because coffee and water stay till you're ready to press. That's how it should have been from the start.

It screws on like original cap but you will only be able to turn about 25% of what you think should lock into the aeropress. So it WILL feel as though you ought to keep tightening to align the groves of the lid with the aeropress -- do not over tighten as this might damage the aeropress or lid. If it was my design, i would have thought through this part better.

The price should be about 20% of what aeropress lists it at. Imagine if the original cap was $20... how would you feel.

So we live in a world that sees business squeeze every cent out of us if they can. Fine. But you can still get this adapter, and you'll be glad you did because you'll really enjoy the coffee that comes out of the aeropress. I use it with the original and go versions; the clear aeropress was returned due to shoddy plastic weld spots left over from manufacturing.

So, if you decide to spend the money and get it, you'll likely get over the hiked cost and settle down with the fantastic coffee that you can now do.",old man,Revisado en Canadá el 10 de julio de 2023
Step-Up in flavor...Step Down in brewing experience,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been an Aeropress fan well over 7 years and love the product. I take it traveling and very happy with it's performance and durability. I've met Alan Adler at tradeshows and he's a superstar along with his team.

The good news is, the Flow Control Cap performs the same or better than the standard cap with many brew holes. Yes, it's great that the new cap prevents initial drops getting into the brew early. It's easy to operate, and unless I actually knew I was using the 'new' cap...I wouldn't have known the difference during brewing. So, very happy with the final coffee product it makes.

The not so good new is, I think Aeropress fell short on this new brewing cap. As others have mentioned, during the last 1/3 of the press, I also experience 'gurgling' or bubbling / leaking around the edges where the cap fits the body. The press I use is probably 4 years old so maybe it's not a perfect fit, but I did put it on tightly.

The second, and most 'pressing' issue is, the darn filter stays inside the cap when you remove it. Alan's videos always showed him ejecting the coffee grinds and paper filter in one shot, right into the garbage or recycle bin. Now I have to fish out the filter (with hot grinds on it) and bring it to the bin. Basically it's a mess and for that reason alone I'll switch back to the old cap. I'll keep the new one just for fun, but I can't wrap my head around having to work harder for my coffee that's really only marginally 'better'. And, for those who know about this trick, on the Prismo video, they suggest pulling the cylinder back to get the filter off the cap...but it didn't work for me.

Again, I love the Aeropress in an of itself and will continue to use it, but with the old cap. I hope the R&D folks can figure out how to stop the leaking and make the filter release from the cap for ejection.",Cooking Heaven,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de abril de 2023

Probably increased the pressure, but I’m not sure why or how, but I was able to make cups of more or less espressos with foamy frothy crema. I am a fan for the ease for aeropress-o on the go once again.",ichitumi,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de julio de 2024
Best way (currently) to use metal filter screen,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This incorporates a ketchup bottle squeeze valve which only allows liquid to pass through when you press on it, thereby permitting water to remain in the cylinder until you're ready. When I tried a metal filter with the normal cap, water would pour straight through it without so much as a by-your-leave, resulting in a brown but flavorless liquid (with fine silt at the bottom of my cup). The flow control valve allows me to brew actual coffee (with fine silt at the bottom).

That's the positive, now the not-so-positive and negative:

The valve has four little posts around it. Before your first use I would recommend pressing on these to make sure they are level with the little risers inside the cap. Mine was a little higher when it arrived, and put a tiny dent in my metal filter. Before the second use, I pressed on it with my finger and it went ""click"" and is now level.

The squirt valve works great when liquid is passing through it, but once you get to the air pocket it sputters and sprays. This is what causes the ""coffee running down the sides of the mug"" problem that some reviewers experienced. I checked very carefully and verified that the cap is NOT leaking around the seal, and coffee is only escaping through the valve. That running-down-the-sides coffee is getting splashed up from INSIDE THE MUG by bursts of air from the valve. I recommend that you STOP pressing when you get to the air bubble, lift the Aeropress off of your mug, and push the piston down the rest of the way over the sink.

This cap is about 6mm thicker/taller than the original cap. That extra thickness goes down into your cup and leaves that much less room for coffee. Great if you plan to put cream in it, disappointing if you drink it black.

Even after pressing all the way down, this cap leaves my coffee grounds significantly wetter than the original cap does. That's a few drops of liquid that didn't go into my cup (what a tragedy) and a slightly messier cleanup.

Speaking of cleanup, there is a rubber gasket ring that you probably should knock out of there (assuming it doesn't fall out on its own, watch out for that) to give the whole assembly a proper rinse after each use.

All in all, this gadget gets the job done (when the job is holding water in the cylinder long enough to allow actual coffee to form) but I can't understand why Aeropress didn't go the simple and obvious route: To reduce flow rate, just make a filter with FEWER HOLES. Am I crazy? Is there a reason why that wouldn't work?? One star removed for being more fiddly than it needed to be.",J. W. Kennedy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de febrero de 2024

Much better than the cap that's included with the AeroPress,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This cap is great for avoiding drips, unlike the cap that is included with the AeroPress. Mine let the liquid almost immediately begin to drip through before any pressure on the plunger is applied. As long as you ensure the flow control cap is on snugly, it does not let liquid through until you want it to. Just be sure to position the AeroPress it over a sturdy mug or small carafe *before* you put the plunger into position. Just putting it into the top can produce enough pressure to cause a little liquid to come through the cap. But despite doing that very thing a couple of times myself, I like this cap much better than the drippy one!

I have just one teeny complaint. I began using the paper filters with this cap but soon ordered the metal filter when I continued to have the paper stick in the cap when I tried to clean it out. I had to either get my fingers covered in grounds or use something to pull up an edge of the paper filter to grab it to lift it out. The metal filter is heavy enough to drop out of the cap with no effort. Not much of a complaint, but I'm quite happy with the cap and metal filter combo.",blueskys,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de enero de 2024
"Works, but only after modification","3,0 de 5 estrellas","The flow-control cap I received didn't properly fit the aeropress carafe. The flanges on the edges that fit into the bottom of the carafe were too thick - when you turned the cap to affix it to the carafe, it wouldn't turn all the way. This leaves gaps, and allows for leakage when you press the plunger. You wouldn't notice the poor fit if you didn't turn the carafe upside down and look at it. (Please refer to photos. First shows flange not fully inserted. Second shows it fully inserted.) That's when I saw that, though I had turned the cap as far as it would go, there was still ¼ inch left of the channel that the flanges fit into. I had to take a metal file and file down the flanges until they fully fit into the carafe. The insertion of filters, metal and/or paper, make a big difference, too. I got the cap to fit, then put in filters and it didn't fit any more. So I had to file it some more. It works now, though there is still leakage when you get down to the air pocket between grounds and plunger.
Another difficulty with this product is that the paper filters don't want to come out of the cap. The irregular surface on the inside of the cap just grabs the paper filter and doesn't want to let go. I have fixed this problem by inserting a metal filter first, then a paper filter on top of that. Why use the paper at all? It's easier to separate the metal filter from the paper one and make sure it doesn't get thrown away. This dual filter definitely made a difference in getting the cap to fit the carafe.
All in all, the product does control the flow of coffee, so it doesn't all leak through before you press the plunger. But the path to getting it to work as it should was much more difficult than it should have been. I hope this has been helpful.",GaiaLady,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de diciembre de 2023
Higher learning curve for stronger coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","If the appeal of an Aeropress is to make a relatively strong cup of coffee with relatively minimal fuss, this alternative filter cap makes a stronger cup of coffee but makes the device a lot more fussy.

If you're not careful about tightening the cap on the Aeropress in just the right way, the coffee can easily leak out of the sides while you press out the coffee. The increased vacuum afforded by the cap also makes the filter and grounds a lot harder to get out afterwards, making cleaning more difficult too.

Despite that, the cap does in fact help make a stronger cup of coffee by preventing passive flow during the immersion phase and restricting the flow of coffee to a single point during the draw down. If that appeals to you and you don't mind the increased hassle, I can say that the cap is worth the price.",Michele,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de diciembre de 2023
"As advertised, but...","4,0 de 5 estrellas","This works as expected. If you thought that the original let the water sieve through too fast and wanted to let the water soak into the coffee grinds more then this does exactly that. So, why only 4 stars?

What isn't mentioned anywhere is what if clean up is more important to you? What this product doesn't do compared to the original is when you release the end part to put the grinds in the garbage it does not come out in one neat, easy puck. What it does do is break apart into the biggest coffee grind mess. I suspect it is because unlike the original, there are no holes in the bottom except for the sealed hole, thus making a suction so the coffee grinds do not just pop out.

So before buying this, you have to decide what your priority is, do you want more soak time or easy cleanup? Because you cannot have both.

Give your AeroPress a boost,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","For a fuller bodied coffee-this is a great addition. It works a little like a syringe-right? But that new spout directs water through a much smaller, more focused space which has some good outcomes and some to consider. GOOD? The water mixed with coffee-is stirred as directed in the AeroPress instructions but I was always frustrated just a little that it began to come out of the bottom a bit before I pressed the plunger. Now my coffee is fuller bodied -more on the espresso side-which I like. Only drawbacks-it takes quite a bit more muscle to plunge and press your Aeropress with the smaller hole. I can deal with that but someone watching can obviously see that you need to exert more pressure to fully press the coffee. Also the filter doesn’t release as easily -I learned a trick-pull the plunger back a little to pull it off the cap-take the cap off then proceed with the grounds and filter expulsion. All in all-I use it every day and love it. I also put a little cream in the bottom of my cup before brewing and I get a great crema with this.",Ronda Gilger,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de enero de 2024
Nice product for those with the need,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","There are so many ways to brew with an AeroPress, it is an individual-by-individual decision as to whether one needs it.

I bought it because it put me over the limit for free shipping, so the cost was negligible. I already own the Fellow version which is very similar. I would say I do like the AeroPress version a little more, but I'm not sure it is a game changer if one already owns the Fellow. Both make a more potent coffee (as in more espresso like), and both are preferred by me in replicating the extraction I want.

I am not a fan of the inversion method that many AeroPress enthusiasts prefer. A handful of drips don't bother me pre-press, but the flow control cap negates that aspect as well.

"Works as advertised, but...","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I'm giving this product four stars because it does exactly what it claims to do. It seems well-made and I think it will last as long as the rest of my AeroPress system. There is one issue that keeps me from giving it five stars. With the original filter cap, when I remove it after brewing, the filter(s) stick to the coffee grounds making it easy to press the plunger down and drop the filter(s) and grounds into the trash. Unfortunately, with this new cap, the filter(s) and some of the grounds stay on the cap making more of a mess to clean. AeroPress customer service responded promptly to my question about this telling me to use the stir paddle to scrape the filter off the cap. This works, but it is still messier than using the original cap. I'm still trying to decide if there is enough of a difference in flavor to justify using the no-drip cap, but I think the answer is going to turn out to be no.",Amazon user,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de septiembre de 2023
"Great design, why didn’t the aero press come with it??","4,0 de 5 estrellas","The original cap that came with the aero press is a very bad design and was such a pain to work around that I stopped using it for a while. I tried the inverted method but had multiple batches explode everywhere when the plunger slipped. If you don’t invert it you can’t steep your coffee at all before the water pours straight through it, which leads to a watered down disappointing brew and almost caused me to get rid of my aeropress.

This completely fixed that problem with no drawbacks and still uses the paper filters. I also found that if you put decent pressure on it the filter still pops off for disposal like with the original cap.

The only reason it doesn’t get a 5 star rating is the obvious cash grab. Come on aero press-there’s no reason this shouldn’t just be the standard design shipped with every unit.",Josh,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de noviembre de 2023
Improvement over the Aeropress Original Screw Cap,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","My Original Aeropress had two areas that needed correction, and the two after-market items—available from Amazon—that did the correcting were (1) the AeroPress Flow Control Filter Cap along with (2) an Altura stainless steel DIsc filter. Paper filters are for me undesirable because they reduce the mouthfeel and flavor of the brew by trapping coffee oils. And the original Aeropress twist cap lets the brew leak out immediately, making it impossible to choose the immersion time. Control of your immersion time therefore necessitates using the inverted method, which thereby reduces the usable interior volume so that in order to make a normal sized cup of coffee you need to then add more hot water after pressing out your brew. The Aeropress Flow Control FIlter Cap is not absolutely drip-free but it is close enough. The slight increase in required pressure helps to extract a bit more of the good stuff inside those ground coffee beans. So although it's kinda expensive, it is an improvement over the original screw cap. I also have the new Aeropress XL and it has the same two defects of the Original, and it therefore also needs both a proper-sized Flow Control Filter Cap and a larger Altura Disc Filter. Then it will be as good as it can be.",billy the k,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de julio de 2023

So, now I have two filter caps.

It turns out the coffee was actually coming out where the cap attaches. If it is connected very tightly no coffee will prematurely drip into the mug. I find if I wet the paper filter before putting the cap on, it's easier to get on tight enough.)

As far as taste goes, I had mixed results. I brewed two times using different roasts. My first cup was a dark roast. I like it about the same as without the valve. My second cup was a blonde roast. That cup was much better with the valve than without. I was surprised how much more I liked it. I never used the inverted method so I can''t compare it to that but I'm sure results would be similar.

I can't compare it directly with the Prismo as I've never tried it. But, from what I understand,the Prismo can't be used with only a paper filter. That is probably the only advantage to the Aeropress filter cap. So, if you don't care about a metal filter, buy the Aeropress and save five bucks. If you want a metal filter, the Prismo seems to be a better value since it has one included.",Ainm Bréige,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de marzo de 2023
How to fix side leak,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This cap retains liquid very well, with only minor leaks along the side. Which is likely not a problem from a brewing perspective and way more convenient/safer than inverted method. However if you do want a perfect seal, then all you have to do is find a small rubber band put it around the barrel and then push it up when you go to lock the cap. no more dripping from either way. Kind of wish they'd include either a super thin o ring or otherwise to fix this for all buyers.

NOTE: this will make the cap incredibly hard to twist. Might not be worth it to you to do so, but I find that a bit of water around the rubber band will usually make the whole thing slide well enough to close.

Otherwise, it does what I expect it to, so 4 stars for the jerry rigged fix.",Brian,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de junio de 2023
It does just fine,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Purchased to aid in losing brew water with traditional (non-inverted) recipes. This does exactly that without changing the final extraction pressure too greatly and I'm happy.

People complaining about it not cleaning as easily as the standard cap: if you draw back on the syringe after finishing your extraction, then it will suck air back into the chamber, pulling the filter and grounds back just enough to stay put when you unscrew the cap and then you can just press the grounds out as normal. Science!

Also, I was pretty sure my Aeropress is pre 2014 and might have fitment issues as mentioned in the product description. I do have a small trickle of leakage on the side of the cap when pressing but it's post-filter leakage (no grounds) and it's so small I'm not worried about purchasing a new model unless it somehow gets a lot worse. Mileage may vary, I'm sure, but figured I would share",Christopher V.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de noviembre de 2023
Works great but does not make AeorPress Go fit together for storage,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","First, the ones who said the filter sticks to the bottom. Pull back the plunger a little bit before removing the cap. This pulls the paper filter back then aim in the trash can and push the plunger to eject the puck and filter. Picture attached showing how it looks like if you pull it back.

The main reason I purchased is so I do not have the mix the creamer with a spoon/stirrer, the pressure from plunging and nozzle mixes the creamer, and I can use the paper filters. Like others I have used the Prismo with both a paper filter and metal filter - mainly to keep washing down to a minimum. Unlike the Prismo, this AeroPress Cap makes the AeroPress Go no more ""travel"" friendly. The red cover no longer attaches to the cup and everything doesn't stay together unless you remove the filter container and keep it separate.",Freggie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de junio de 2023
2 AEROPRESS CHAMBERS CRACKED.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Hello everyone! This is my review for the new Aeropress Filter flow control cap:

DO NOT BUY IT. ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOVE YOUR AEROPRESS. ITS A WASTE OF MONEY. IT BROKE TWO CHAMBERS.

This cap does wonders, it allows you to bypass the “inverted method” so you don’t have to flip anything or risk burning yourself and making a mess. This product seemed like an easy buy to fix the drip issue with the OG cap that it comes with, I thought it would have been great. And it was, I loved using the product and it does what it does as advertised. I love that you can use paper filters or the metal one, it’s very versatile.

But save your money and just use the inverted method. I have an Aeropress Go. The first couple of times I put the new cap on the Go, it got unbelievably stuck. I nearly broke my wrist trying to unscrew it every morning. Eventually, it got easier to screw on and off, but with a catch. I noticed there was a giant crack line on the aeropress chamber. I was devastated. (Pictures 1 and 2 are the old chamber with the crack)

I contacted aeropress support about it and they happily explained that the cap should be tight, but not tight enough where it’s almost impossible to screw off. They happily sent me a new Go chamber to replace the cracked one. I got it yesterday and was so excited to try the cap again with this new one! I thought since it was new it’d probably be easier to screw on and off and should work better.

Boy, was I wrong. This morning sucked. The cap got super stuck AGAIN on the brand new chamber, and when I finally unscrewed it, you guessed it. Another new crack line discovered, on a brand new chamber. I know it’s not the chambers fault that it broke - I immediately switched to just the given cap and that works perfect. But I am so mad that this flow cap just broke a new chamber. A NEW ONE. (Picture 3 is the new chamber with the crack)

Therefore, this thing is a waste of money. Don’t buy it, it will break your Aeropress. It literally did it twice. Save your money and don’t break the chamber, just to stop the drip through. I can’t say that if I had a regular aeropress, it’d do the same thing, but regardless I can’t believe this happened twice.

Aeropress, thanks for being a great company, and your service team helped me a lot. But fix your product, it’s terrible.",Nick Sciortino,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de agosto de 2023
This thing leaks!!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","The very first time I used this, it leaked. I thought hmm, maybe I didn’t tighten it enough or something, so I tried again the next day and still had issues. Rather than go through a return, I reached out to AeroPress customer service to see if they could help. They didn’t respond to my first message, so I followed up. They responded to my second one with tips on how to use it (I was already using it as directed, based on the tips in their email) and they asked me to send photos/videos showing the leak if the tips didn’t work (which I also did). It has been over two weeks and they haven’t responded to me, even after following up a couple times. I am now past the return window and left with a defective product. Very disappointed with AeroPress. The brewer is great, but this cap sucks. I’d recommend going with the Fellow Prismo over this. They’re the same price, but the fellow one is higher quality and even comes with a stainless steel filter (which AeroPress would want to charge you an extra $15 for). One of the reasons I decided to give this cap a try even though I had the fellow Prismo is because I wanted to be able to use it with just a paper filter (you can use the fellow Prismo with a paper filter, but you also have to use the metal filter as it creates a seal). I’m going back to the fellow Prismo, I’m tired of dealing with leaks in a product that I as supposed to control the flow of my coffee.",martina,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de junio de 2023
Doesn't seal,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Unfortunately it just doesn't work - it leaks a good amount of coffee, defeating the purpose of having a flow control cap to begin with. I will say that if you tighten the cap extremely tight, it reduces the leakage a good amount, but not competely. I also bought the other leading competitor cap and have no leaking issues whatsoever with that one (not sure if I can mention other brand names in reviews, but its about $30 and comes with a metal screen).

*EDIT UPDATE*: The company did send me a replacement free of charge, however it has the same problem. I will say that if you tighten the cap extremely tight, it reduces the leakage a good amount, but not competely.

"Comparable to the Prismo, except it leaks.","1,0 de 5 estrellas","I have the new clear Aeropress, and an Aeropress to Go and I wanted a second cap with a valve so I can make strong coffee shots back to back, or two cold brews. The Aeropress Flow Control Cap produces great coffee like I get with the Prismo, but it also leaks coffee a ton. You can make strong espresso like shots like the Prismo, but as you quickly push down the plunger, coffee will leak out the sides. You can make cold brew like the Prismo, but unless you invert, you’ll be left with a big puddle of coffee as it brews.

It’s also harder to remove the filter from the cap than the Prismo.

I’m returning this cap and buying a second Prismo.",J. Singh,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de junio de 2023
"""New and improved"": not really","1,0 de 5 estrellas","The previous design of this cap, with a mesh-like bottom, allowed coffee to filter through to your cup.

Terrible!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I love my Aeropress, but this is a terrible add-on. Double up on your paper filter or do the inverse method if you worry about pass through while brewing. The fit is terrible, it takes an excessive amount of force to have a secure seal, otherwise it leaks around the outer edge. And if you’re looking for that “espresso style crema” as advertised, look elsewhere cause this ain’t it.

Bad experience,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I typically use the Aeropress Go with a metal filter. The Aeropress Go is fairly small, so usually I do two batches for a full mug of coffee (add coffee grounds, add water, press, pull out plunger, add more water, press again).

Firstly, this does NOT fit the Aeropress Go if you use a metal filter. I ended up with coffee grounds everywhere, not realizing the Flow Control Cap did not actually fit and was not secure. So I had to clean up that mess and get a paper filter instead. It DID work with the paper filter (hence 2 stars instead of 1), BUT when I went in for my second batch, that's where everything went even more wrong. I pulled out the plunger and added water as usual. When I went to press the plunger down, it would not budge. I could see the sides of the Aeropress bulging a little bit each time I tried to press down, as though there was nowhere for the air to go. From there, I had to find a creative way to get my coffee out and my kitchen became a disaster. I felt like one of those people in the infomercials where everything goes wrong.

Not a great product. Filter sticks and poor fit.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This cap is a poor fit on the aeropress body, even when snugly tightened down. This means the cap leaks when pressing down the piston. Secondly the filter and puck fragments stick to the cap. This negates a defining feature of the aeropress - that is discarding the puck and paper in one swift press of the plunger. Using this alternative cap means you have to dig out the paper (preferably using plastic tool) so one doesn't damage the seal surface and ruin it over time. Had to send back as these nuisances far offset the negligible drip through problem, which can already be worked around nicley using 2x papers and the piston to hold a vacuum while its brewing.",Jeff,Revisado en Reino Unido el 10 de septiembre de 2023

To my dismay, mine leaks when pressing the coffee into my mug. Specifically a small amount of coffee spews from around the edge where the Flow Control edge meets the Aeopress body, and drips outside of my cup, which drips down the sides leaving a sizable coffee ring under my cup. Thinking it was an anomaly, I returned it and got another from Amazon. Same problem with the second one no matter how tight I cranked the Flow Control cap onto my Aeopress.

Saved me from quitting aeropress,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I almost gave up on AeroPress. I was not enjoying the experience. I was so fed up with the mess of inverting the press, losing precious immersion time while the original filter cap let coffee thru early, and too little pressure to get a pseudo espresso.

This flow control filter cap saved the day. No more dripping before immersion is done. No more mess/risk from inverting the press, and it offers enough added pressure to see a little crema on top of the cup. I'm SO glad I didn't give up on the press.

My only serious gripe is the price. This filter cap was nearly the price of the AeroPress. IMO, it's a necessity if you're going to use an AeroPress every day. So, it should be standard equipment. I know they just go bought out and the new owners are trying to milk this cash cow for every penny, but come on guys, $25 is too much for an accessory for a $35 AeroPress.",GunNut37086,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de diciembre de 2023

I've had the black Aeropress for years and recently got the transparent one, which I appreciate. Two comparable coffee makers would double my cups. I use Cafe Bustelo or Pilon, so ordinary ground coffee may taste different. Since I've started using the fine grind, my ordinary beans taste bland, and I add ground cinnamon and ginger to my ground coffee, which can clog screens.

"Leaks when pressing, Prismo doesn't","3,0 de 5 estrellas","I really wanted this to work, as the cleanup is more simple than the Prismo, but unfortunately it leaks even when fully tightened on a brand new Aeropress (using paper filter only). The Prismo has a metal filter with a rubberized gasket, which creates a much tighter seal and doesn't allow coffee to escape through the sides, which is the problem with the Flow Control Cap.

The pressure valve doesn't seem to be easily replaceable either, which is another benefit of the Prismo.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de marzo de 2023

"No drips through the extraction seal, but not entirely leak proof","3,0 de 5 estrellas","This cap looks to strive one of the main problems when using an AeroPress extractor, keeping the water in the press while filling/steeping. I found the extraction to be smooth and not require any excessive pressure. The end result of the coffee was as expected according to my preferred ratios , grind, steeping times.

The main reason for this is the no drip feature. And the extractor hole in the middle does an excellent job at this. I do however get some leaking around the edges of the where the cap seals to the tube even if tightened as fully as possible.

Leaks,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I really wanted to like this flow cap. Big fan of the Aeropress and use it often (particularly while traveling).

When I used this with metal filters, it leaks out the side through the gap between the cap and the body while pressed. To be fair, there was no leakage into the cup from the center hole with a metal filter so that part was successful. I have tried with with paper and seems better but not why this was intended.

"Doesn't produce additional crema, does let you control timing","3,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been brewing coffee via the aeropress upside down method for years. It can be a little precarious when I'm extra clumsy, but I also produce a reliably brewed drink, and often a little crema of dense foam.

I haven't tried third-party filter caps that others have mentioned.

Don't get this if you're seeking crema. Using both my usual upside down proportions and the ones in the product video, and very fresh beans, I couldn't get crema. I got straight up bubbles that disappeared quickly.

However, the cap did not leak around the sides when I applied pressure. Nor did the water flow through the coffee until I depressed the plunger. I tried with both paper filters, a third-party stainless steel filter, and while it was a tight fit --- both.

I do think this should probably become the products default filter cap, simply because of the brewing time control. But as an ""upgrade"" to an existing system? Not for over $20.",ReviewingStuff,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de abril de 2023
"Better than stock, but leaks a little.","3,0 de 5 estrellas","This is definitely an upgrade over the stock filter holder. We used to fill our aeropress upside down and flip it onto the mug. Sometimes that was less than successful. We used this new filter cap with a reusable metal mesh filter. The ""seal"" is the same as those on sports drink bottles. It's a little membrane with a cross cut into it so that will let liquids through under pressure. As you can see in the video ours leaks and it seems to leak around the membrane not from it. It has nothing to do with using a reusable filter as the filter is fully contained in the cap just like the lid on a bottle. It probably doesn't matter for your coffee if you prep over a mug, but we expected a ""no drip"" cap to, you know, not drip.",Brutal Engineering,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de abril de 2023

Gets better,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",At first I didn't like this so much. Sort of leaked but after about 5 or so uses I didn't have to tighten as much.

Mixed feelings,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","By way of background: I've been using an Aeropress for more than a decade. I own 3 (for different locations) and all three are different generations and I love them all equally. I've gifted over a dozen to my favorite people over the years. I love this invention.

This little innovation though, clearly on the heels of what the folks over at Fellows did with the Prismo and a step in 'that' direction but is it the 'right' direction? I am not convinced, especially given how revolutionary the original Aeropress was. Btw, the Aeropress valve cap appears to be a different design than the Prismo.

What I like:
- no premature drips when using the standard method, and therefore no need to use the inverted method.
- well constructed and appears to be universally compatible w/ all generations of the Aeropress.

What I dislike (in order of gripy'ness):
- paper filter stays glued to the cap and gets messy trying to get it off, compared to the reliable process on the original cap, where the used paper is exposed as soon as you take the cap off, and you can choose to discard it by plunging it into the trash along w/ the puck OR remove and wash it, and reuse it.
- have to push harder (depending on the fineness of your grind) on the plunger due to the valve - which might yield bitterness in the cup.

After a few weeks of ownership, I find that light/medium roasts do really well w/ the valve cap but the net result is definitely not espresso. Medium/dark roasts are better (smoother, specifically) w/ the original cap compared to the valve cap. I find the valve cap begins to introduce some bitterness that deviates from the smoothness that the Aeropress is known for. Also, the bitterness is managed when you use cream/sugar but prevalent if drinking straight up.. so it may not bother you if you typically take your coffee w/ cream and/or sugar.",Sam J,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de mayo de 2023
"Evolution, not revolution","4,0 de 5 estrellas","AeroPress makes great stuff - I’ve had my original press for over a decade, picked up a second one for the office, have bought them as gifts for friends and family, and, in a testament to how well thought-out their design process is, am on my second set of seals after the first started to wear out. Suffice it to say, I was thrilled at the prospect of a flow control cap that would let me generate more pressure and avoid mid-brew drips. I’ve become a fan of moka pot-brewed coffee, so I was curious to see if I could coax more intensity from my AeroPress-brewed presses.

The cap itself is of the quality I’ve come to expect from everything AeroPress does - solid, precisely engineered, and of obvious quality. Instead of the familiar matrix of round holes, this new cap has a single hole with a cross-cut membrane in it (think of modern condiment squeeze bottle caps), with a pattern of raised ridges inside the cap to guide the coffee through its new exit. The cap seats tightly on the cylinder when you twist it into place.

Following the recommendations included in the box and on the AeroPress website, I went for a preliminary stir (per normal brewing), followed by an extended steep (impossible in normal brewing, thanks to gradual leakage through the standard cap).

First, and most importantly, the coffee was delicious. That smooth, no-bitterness coffee that AeroPress excels at producing. Thanks to the new no-drip cap and the longer brew time, the flavor was deeper and stronger than I could get with my original cap. The extra pressure also allows for crema - it matches the bloom from when you first add hot water beautifully. It’s still not espresso (or moka) strength, but it is a step up from the basic configuration if you like your coffee strong.

Performance-wise, I would call this more of an improvement over a standard AeroPress than a true no-drip cap. You’re not going to suddenly start getting espressos. As you can see in the picture (I made a latte for the contrast with the milk), there are some drips, but they are minor compared to a standard cap. So still not as effective for longer brew time as adding water and inverting the unit, using the plunger as a stopper, but much easier and equally delicious.",J. P. Hann,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de abril de 2023
"Not really espresso, but comes closer than just strong coffee","4,0 de 5 estrellas","It takes quite a bit of strength to apply the pressure that's necessary to push hot water through coffee grounds and the single, tiny hole of this accessory filter cap. So, you'll need a very sturdy mug to use with it when pairing it with an AeroPress. Of course, the pressure (though not nearly as much as in a true espresso machine) is what produces the foamy pseudo-crema from this product.
Note that this only replaces the standard filter cap on the AeroPress Coffee Maker with a cap that has a resistive, one-way valve on it. The Aeropress system itself needs to be purchased separately.
This accessory does messily spit out good, strong coffee with a bit of something that looks like an espresso crema; though it doesn't produce much of it, and it disappears quickly, since it is only a little foamy.
The AeroPress coffee maker always does make good coffee; and with this accessory, it gets a little closer to producing an espresso.
But, still, not quite the real thing.",davidthawaii,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de mayo de 2023
Works fine on AeroPress Go Portable Travel Kit,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Initially this is a bit of a struggle to get attached, especially compared to the OEM version, but don't worry it will fit. It's snug for a reason - so it won't leak and will withstand the increased pressure it was designed for, to produce a better almost espresso like cup of coffee. To say the AeroPress can make espresso is nonsense. It wasn't designed for that purpose and cannot withstand the pressures required to make good espresso, but it does make an excellent cup of joe in my opinion. The most important thing is size of grind, and you're just going to have to experiment until you find the one you like best. Start with drip grind size and work your way down from there until you find the sweet spot. For those who are new to AeroPress world, never, ever put your AeroPress in the dishwasher...and never, ever leave the silicone plunger seal compressed inside the tube for more than the time it takes to make a cup of coffee. Once rinsed and dried, push the plunger all the way through until the silicone plunger cap pops out the end of the cylinder (per photo). Note, the new flow control filter cap is taller than the OEM version and as such will not allow the cap to fit if you place the filter wallet on top of it. No big deal for me, but something you should be aware of. Overall, I really like this and after a little getting used to, I'm making better coffee in the AeroPress than before. Although my go to coffee maker at home these days is a Breville Nespresso Vertuo, that puts a world class crema on top of each shot, but I digress. This is certainly worth the small investment and something I would recommend to every AeroPress aficionado. Afterall, you didn't wind up with one of these machines because you don't care about flavor. You obviously do, and this will give you one more option to up your game. Just be prepared for a little fussing around to get it dialed in...and to get that dang thing tightly attached. Don't give up, it will be worth your time. Prepare for one disaster and if it doesn't happen, all the better. Cheers!",NashGrasser,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de marzo de 2023
Finally an official pressure cap for Aeropress!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used the Fellow pressure cap and metal filter (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079YBT2LJ) since 2018 with my Aeropress devices. I'm pleased to see Aerobie came out with their own finally, and I was happy to try it out.

The Aeropress cap does not come with a filter. I tested it with the paper filters that I have thousands of, as the Fellow metal filter does not fit (it has a rubber seal rim that has no place to go in the Aeropress cap). It worked well, although I saw some back pressure near the end of the press with the paper filter and cap.

The end result was a good well-extracted cup of coffee/espresso as I would expect with the other product.

I did not have a plain metal filter handy, but plan to try with one to see how well it works.

If I were choosing between the products today, I would still go with the Fellow Prismo because it comes with the permanent filter, unlike the Aeropress one. But if you prefer paper filters, or have a plain metal filter, the Aeropress will not disappoint.",Robert Novak,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de mayo de 2023
Worthwhile Aeropress accessory,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I used this Aeropress accessory with both paper and metal filters, and found it useful. It does eliminate the need to invert if you want leak-free steeping time, and it doesn't seem to require a lot of extra pressure to use, at least with my grind sizes. I did experiment a bit with espresso-like grinds and dosages, and the strong coffee which resulted had a nice taste and mouthfeel. There were resulting tan-colored air bubbles, which many people would mistake for genuine crema. It's helpful that this valve is usable with small espresso cups. I do wish the Aeropress marketing people would avoid the implication that ""espresso"" can be made with their products, since it cannot (at least not without major hardware hacking), and since the Aeropress has so many things to recommend it without that implication. I had no leakage problems with this device, and plan on replacing the original filter cap with this for permanent use.",white rat,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de abril de 2023
Nice Option For Original AeroPress,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I love my original aero press and use it often. I saw this option on Amazon for a flow control filter cap. I have been using the inverted method of putting in my coffee pouring in the water, stirring and adding the cap. It works fine, but this filter cap gives me the option of brewing with more pressure and into a smaller cup without the adapter.

Upon opening the box, I was impressed that there was a QR code for instructions on how to use the flow control filter cap. The instructions took me directly to the official arrow press website. The instructions are easy to follow.

I have made coffee both the original way, and with the new flow control. I personally am not a coffee connoisseur, so I do not know which taste better for everyone. My preference is it using the flow control allows me to not have to use the inverted method, and also allows me to brew directly into a small cup without the adapter.

I am only docking one star for this item because they are pricey for what you get. However, if you really love coffee and your aero press, I would recommend this device.",J. Kinney,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de marzo de 2023

This cap has just been a change of pace and something a little different to play with. I do get more crema than with my normal method. It makes a decent cup of coffee. I don't have any leaking while being or when I press. I suspect this could be different based on the age and material of your Aeropress as they have changed over the years. It's nice that there's less worry of knocking it over,but I have had to switch up my routine. I normally pour water into it from my JavaJug then press into the jug rather than a cup,so I'll have to figure out a new routine. Overall, I like it, it's a fun gadget.

Best Invention of Aeropress,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This method stops the dripping during brewing. Previously, I used the inverted brewing technique with the AeroPress, which involves setting it upside down during brewing and then carefully flipping it to press. However, flipping it carelessly can lead to hot coffee splashing out, risking scalds. I once spilled hot coffee on my legs, resulting in a burn scar that took a year and a half to fade. The new flow control filter cap eliminates dripping, ensuring optimal flavor extraction from the coffee grounds without the risk of burns. It's as easy to clean as the original filter cap.

Game changer for an already amazing product,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been using the Aeropress with the stock cap and paper filters to make Americanos and have been thrilled with the results. However, I was never able to make a rich cup of cold brew because the long (1-minute) stir time allowed too much water to seep into the cup before plunging. And I never tried the inverted method because it sounded like too much planning, hassle, and potential for a mess. However, with the Flow Control Filter Cap, zero water gets through until you plunge, so the grinds get super saturated, and the result is a rich cup of cold brew in just one minute. This is truly nearly as good as Toddy cold brew, albeit with far less time, effort, and counter space. You can also now use pre-ground coffee — which has a slightly coarser-than-recommended grind — without the water quickly draining into your cup. The Flow Control Filter Cap unlocks the full potential and versatility of the Aeropress to the point that I now use it more than my Cuisinart coffee maker, and I look forward to traveling with it so I no longer have to search for good coffee while on the road.",wordnrrrd,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de julio de 2023
Now you can use any cup/mug you want with the aeropress,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I don’t usually leave reviews but I thought this tidbit might be helpful for the right reader.

In combination with my travel version of the Aeropress it is the perfect coffee set up for someone who travels a lot or uses their aeropress outside of the home. I live on a sailboat about half of the year and travel around the country the rest of the time so it’s important to have the sturdy, effective, and quality versions of the essentials.

Ahhhhh! The leak-stopped - my solution,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",After using the AP flow control filter cap I noticed coffee leaking down the sides of all my mugs. Read all the reviews mentioning this. My conclusion-stop pushing/rushing the AeroPress push. A slower push prevents any side leaking for me. Let the weight of your hands do most of the work with a slight downward press. I tested and confirmed no leaks on my AP Clear and previous model. Haven’t tested the AP Go yet. This cap is great for getting the inverted method effect without the mess risk.,WdGldDave,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de octubre de 2023
I 2nd that it should come in the box with the aeropress,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This piece solves the things that annoyed me with the original unit. It’s now easier to get a more consistent brew without the water dripping out the original cap. Some have complained it’s harder to clean, but it does fine if you pull the plunger back just a bit before removing the cap to eject the puck. My only gripe: why did I wait so long to try it!?! It’s easier to press now, too. A huge win for me.",Anonymous722,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de octubre de 2023
Much better than the standard filter cap,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",No longer need to do the inverted brew method. This filter cap keeps everything in the brew chamber until you plunge. Safer and more convenient than inverted brew method.,Radek Shadoobie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de enero de 2024
A solid addition to my AeroPress collection,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","A great way to handle flow control without the need to do the inverted method. 2x AeroPress purchaser, works great with the classic and the go",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de enero de 2024
"No drips, no grounds with fine metal fiilter","5,0 de 5 estrellas","Simple perfect complement to add to your aero press making it cleaner, easier to use and still you can pick your own filter.",Greg,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de enero de 2024
Should be included with AeroPress,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",Exactly what my title says. It’s producing some of the best coffee I’ve had with my AeroPress with no leaks. I now use inverted recipes without having to invert. I love the AeroPress 2021 World Champion’s recipe and now just don’t invert and I don’t spill or drip everywhere and it tastes better too. Looking forward to trying a different roast on make an espresso with crema very soon!,Gary Fletcher,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de octubre de 2023
A great upgrade for a stronger cup of coffee!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",This works wonderfully when used normally or using the inverted method. (You can add the Altura metal disc and do away with paper filters too!) This cap is a real upgrade for the Aero-Press!,T. Farner,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de enero de 2024
Makes the closest thing to espresso,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",Love my aeropress especially for travel. This slows you to brew better with different grinds and even generate a crema!,Arthur Gabinet,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de febrero de 2024
