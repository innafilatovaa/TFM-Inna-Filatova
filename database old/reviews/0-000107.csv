Perfect gift for a coffee fan!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",This is so cool ! Great gift for people that loves coffee and travel a lot. I bought this for my husband when we go on vacation/traveling or camping. I also bought the extension so he can use the orignal nespresso capsules. HE LOVES IT!,Amazon Customer,Revisado en Canadá el 1 de enero de 2024
Read the instructions first!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Normally I am not the one to read instructions. That habit failed me when using this product. Once I fully read three the care and instructions on use, it worked like a charm. My husband and I camp often. This device was the perfect thing to fix my espresso craving on trips without coffee nearby. Water temperature is very important to get the best results. I highly reclined running hot water through it alone first and then making coffee. It made a huge difference for the results on my end and it was an instruction in the pamphlet that I didn’t first follow.",Cameron Hendrixson,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de diciembre de 2023

Love it!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I am so pleased with this little espresso maker. I have an espresso machine at home that I typically use on a daily but there are days when I wake up late and don’t have time to use it. I grab this little beauty, my barista kit and my premeasured espresso that I keep in packets in the freezer. As long as I have access to hot water, I can make my Beautiful little double anywhere! It’s super easy to use and not too big of a pain to clean. I’ve taken it to work, camping, and while I’m traveling. The only thing negative I can come up with is the fact that it tells you to weight out 16 g of espresso, but 16 g of espresso doesn’t fit in the little porta filters. Its less, somewhere in between 14 and 15. One of these days I’ll spend the time to figure out exactly how much so I don’t have espresso waste. I am quite impressed with a crema that this thing produces and overall just thrilled with my purchase! The grinder is for sure next on my list of things to purchase. I have to be honest I think I’m just a big fan of the brand I haven’t been disappointed yet.",mary,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de julio de 2023
Leaking around the pump,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I would have given this 5 stars but after around 30 days it’s already leaking around the pump. It’s not a fast leak but every time I pump, a tiny bit of water trickles out of the front of the pump on the outside. I’m a little disappointed as this plastic gadget is very expensive.",taylor95941,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de junio de 2023
Great Quality,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",Bought a few months ago and I am in love! I use this every day in my kitchen because it is a smaller setup.

It makes a good espresso,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I was under the impression that you could load it up and take it up a mountain and make a coffee. You still need to have a source of hot water. I thought you could pre fill it hot and it would keep 'thermos style' for a couple of hours while you went on a walk. No. You still need a source of hot water if you are in the wilds.

The first coffee comes out slightly cooler but the second red hot so I’ve started flushing the system with just hot water first almost as a pre heat. Works a charm. I got the adaptor so I can use Nespresso pods. In terms of cleaning on the go it’s not the easiest so I got a small pouch to pop it all in. Just need a small microfibre towel now and I’m all set.

Spectacular for the Trail or Road,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been using this little beauty on my drives from the United States to Costa Rica and back. Super simple, this produces a fantastic tasting espresso, and a lovely long shot.

I have not yet had any issues with it, despite about 3 months of nearly daily use. If I run into anything, I will update. However, at this point, this machine is putting out some fantastic drinks with consistency, reliability, and simplicity. I love it!

Edit: Having used this nearly daily for 8 months, I have a couple of additions. The device still makes a delightful little drink, but I've now run into a couple of issues. The pump arm/piston now leaks a bit of water around it as you pump, and sometimes you have to prime the pump quite a lot to get it to work. Otherwise, this machine continues to impress. Almost wish there were an aircraft titanium upgrade for those of us who want this to outlast us and go to our kids or maybe survive those of us who need extra tough gear (savages, barbarians, wildmen).

Ich zerlegte darauf hin das Oberteil und siehe da - unter der Dichtung im Kopfteil Unmengen hart verkrusteter alter Kaffeesatz - für den Preis völlig inakzeptabel! Nach der Reinigung baut die Maschine besser den Druck auf, aber der Durchlauf ist immer noch eher Tröpfchenweise und das Ergebnis steht in keinem Verhältnis zum Aufwand und der anschließenden Menge Dreck im WoMo... ich nehme wieder meine gute alte Bialetti...",Lutz N,Revisado en Alemania el 19 de marzo de 2021

Makes great coffee!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","My wife and I enjoy great coffee. So I purchased this for a 2 week vacation we took so we didn't have to get up and go find coffee every morning. I was pretty skeptical of this little portable machine performing, but was pleasantly surprised at how great it worked and how good the coffee was. Pretty simple when you figure it out. It is a little messy dealing with the spent grinds because it's so small, but once you get a system down it's not that big of a deal. Overall it's a really well engineered product. Would really like one that produces a double shot rather than making two singles 😎",LeoFender,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de diciembre de 2020
My best purchase in 2020 hands down,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",I love this little machine so much. I bought this to save money on lattes and it tastes just as good as any coffee shop. It has great body and core and the crema on top is picture perfect. I was saving up for a $500+ espresso machine but I might spend it on something else now as I am satisfied with this. I am so happy with this I actually enjoy my mornings and even look forward to waking up and drinking a double shot espresso or a latte before I start the day. I recommend to buy the barista kit for the extra baskets and the ability to make a double shot latte quickly. I don't own the nespresso adapter as I like freshly grinding my beans so I can't comment on that attachment. Anyone who likes espresso I would reccomend and definitely over cheaper espresso machines. The only people I wouldnt reccomend are people who don't want to be hands on in the espresso making process or if you have arthritis in your hands.,Caitlin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de diciembre de 2020
