I end up heating the milk in a Nespresso frother which means I could have just bought a far less expensive machine.

You don't have to press the button to stop it brewing coffee which is good, but the espresso sizes are small.

You shouldn't buy it,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Short: it will cost you a lot buying replacement parts, do not by Swan coffee machines.
Long:
After around 3 months of usage, the coffee filter was clogged to a point that it couldn' t be used. The machine could not push the water through. I tried to use descaler, it didn't help. I thought it was a faulty one, so I ordered a new filter. After 3 months, it was clogged again. I even dismantled it to be able to clean it as thoroughly as possible, it didn't help.
I contacted their support, as it seems this is a low quality product and a filter costs 14 pounds, so buying one in every 3 months doesn't seem a good option.
Well, to show the quality of their support, their first reply was: ""this can be due to the coffee being over packed or there being too much coffee in the Filter. The water has no where to filter through."" They obviously think their customers have no brain at all.
If you think the support got better after this, don't hope. They basically told me they won't help, but they needed 2 weeks to get to that point. They are slow and still blame COVID.
This was the last Swan product I bought and I am going to buy an other coffee machine. This is the worst I've ever had.

I have to extend my review. It is basically a continuous maintenance project to keep this coffee maker functional. I have to dismantle and assemble the filter so often, I am thinking to buy an other brand. On the top of that, I noticed that water is leaking from the tank. Reason is that if I pour too much water into it, the pressure is too high, so the water leeks... Cleaning the milk container is a pain, too many small parts and holes. This product is definitely overdesigned and nobody who was part of the project actually makes coffee, I think. It looks nice as decoration if it matches you kitchen furtniture, so if you want that, it's for you. Otherwise, find an better one.",Robert Nemet,Revisado en Reino Unido el 8 de marzo de 2022

Be careful moving it,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","When pulling it out to top up the water today I managed to jolt the water container off the connector so ended up with all the water on my work surface. This can be solved by sitting it on a tray to slide in and out easily. I also found the scoop is really annoying. It's too big for the single espresso serving and too small for the large espresso serving. However, once that and the tendency of milk to cook onto the metal froth tube is overlooked, for a ""real"" coffee machine this is relatively simple to set up, use and keep clean. Yes, tassimo pods are easier but so bad for plastic consumption, and I like the flexibility of sizes and milk froth. I also used the milk frother to make the most luxurious hot chocolate. The green colour is elegant too.",Clare,Revisado en Reino Unido el 7 de noviembre de 2021
Most cost effective way to get coffee shop quality at home,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Great coffee machine for the price. I am no coffee expert but dislike coffee pod machines and wanted to start the journey to having coffee shop quality at home and this provides it all.

Very easy to clean and the ease of use of button pressing makes it foolproof!",Cameron M.,Revisado en Reino Unido el 6 de noviembre de 2021
Wouldn‚Äôt recommend,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",If you want a straight coffee without milk this isn‚Äôt the one to buy. Even the large espresso serving is tiny. Also when milk section is low the machine over steams.,Brighton,Revisado en Reino Unido el 27 de octubre de 2021

Best purchase of 2021,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We bought this, as we were spending too much in the local coffee shop. So far this has been the best purchase of this year. It makes a brilliant Macchiato, and with a little practice the husband is starting the rival the major coffee shops with his Caramel Mac!!! In the month we've had this, we have used it more than any other coffee machine we've owned and invariably don't leave the house without a coffee every morning. It is easy to use and cleaning is quick and simple. The fact it takes ground coffee means we can choose the strength and flavour that we want, not 'whats selected/provided' in the pods. We really do love it, time will tell if the love affair lasts.",Karen Fox,Revisado en Reino Unido el 13 de agosto de 2021

Retro coffee machine,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","What I wanted to know was about the pressure? On the box it has 15 bar. But the description it says 20 bar. I bought this on the strength it was 20 bar pressure.
Your customer service has gone down the pan. At one time you were able to speak to a human being, you only speak to a robot now. Even they say they have tried to ring you number but cannot get through... that‚Äôs rubbish. I tried 5 times but still no vail. Because of this I sent it back to Amazon.",Rosalind McCourt,Revisado en Reino Unido el 18 de junio de 2021

"Works well, milk container is very bad","2,0 de 5 estrellas","I haven‚Äôt tried the blending, I mainly got it for making cappuccinos and americanos.

Cappuccinos are the weakness of the machine since the milk frothing doesn‚Äôt come out very well and the milk container is difficult to clean and requires a minimum amount of milk. If it could use all of the milk in the container it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, but you‚Äôll need to clean the milk container every day and it has annoying hard-to-clean corners. My hand doesn‚Äôt fit in the container to reach the corners. You‚Äôll also throw out and waste milk. I have started making americanos exclusively.

If you‚Äôre getting this for cappuccinos, I would recommend getting the other retro machine with the manual frother, since the metal jug is easier to clean and you can use the amount of milk you want and froth it how you like.

I like that a normal mug fits under the machine and you don‚Äôt need a small coffee cup.",Francis Moloney,Revisado en Reino Unido el 17 de febrero de 2021
Great value for money,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Very pleased with this machine from swan, I bought a coffee machine from Curry‚Äôs costing twice as much and sent it back after one week, it just didn‚Äôt do what I expected from it for the price,this machine does a far nicer coffee for half the price.",john webber,Revisado en Reino Unido el 17 de febrero de 2021
