Quality is not there with this product.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought in April of ‘21, it’s now June,’22, didn’t use it over winter, just starting into its 2nd season and none of the little things work anymore. It started out this season fine but went south fast. The stainless ball plug just will not hold the liquid in the reservoir, it started drip leaking and by last night it didn’t hold any of the coffee. It was all in the storage jar by morning. The button you press to release the coffee into the jar leaks too. The silicone gasket split the 1st season. Their warranty only covers the metal parts not the cheap plastic parts that wear out. Looks like I’m in to buy another connector @ $10 a pop and new gasket @$4 if they had stock…
So a $50-60 initial investment then it’s gonna be $14 (plus shipping) every year after that.
At least that is my experience.",Jeff Wolfram,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de junio de 2022
Coffee everyday,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",I have been using this cold brew device for about a month now every day I go to work. I have found no real problems with it so far. I am sure that many people do not have a fridge with the clearance to fit the device with the bottle attached. I have been putting the coffee maker into my fridge for 24 hours at a time and each time I pull it out there is almost never any leakage. Sometimes there are a few drops which is possible if the button got pushed. This has made making coffee at home much easier for me as I do not like hot coffee as much and did not have any luck making cold brews in a jar. I have yet to try using a different bottle as I do not like the ergonomics of the bottle they give you. It is too wide for a comfortable grip.,P,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de febrero de 2022

Bonne méthode d'extraction.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Très bon produit.
J'ai pu tester différentes méthodes pour l'infusion à froid : dans une jare mason, le goutte à goutte, mizudashi bottle, toddy... ; c'est le système le plus sympa pour faire du cold brew coffee. On peut gérer son ratio eau/café pour choisir la concentration.
On a juste à laisser de côté sur le plan de travail entre 12 et 24h00 selon ce que l'on souhaite. On ouvre le petit bouchon plastique au dessus et on appuie sur le bouton pour laisser passer le café infusé dans de réceptacle en dessous. On sépare les 2 parties, on met le bouchon et hop, au frigo pour plusieurs jours... à oui, facile à nettoyer aussi.
A consommer pur, coupé avec de l'eau, froid, chaud... l'avantage est que le café infusé à froid attaque moins l'estomac. Meme si vous le laissez refroidir, vous pouvez le réchauffer, il sera toujours aussi bon, ce qui n'est pas le cas avec un café infusé à chaud.",Niko,Revisado en Francia el 17 de enero de 2021
"Rated best in flavor, easy to use, easy to clean (hand wash), been using nonstop","5,0 de 5 estrellas","Based on CR's rating, I bought this off Amazon this week. CR'r review was spot on!

Using Costco KS Colombian Whole Beans, ground fresh before preparing, this makes great cold brew, very smooth and delightful flavor. (Bit of a cheat here: I have been buying Costco's canned cold brew coffee made from the same stock, and they taste about the same. If anything, this maker produces slightly smoother taste, but I may be making it a bit weaker.) Takes 12-24 hrs to steep; I've let it steep about 18 hours so far to make good dark brew. This device is 100% manual, and you will likely have to pour water over the grounds bit by bit until the top section is full. Water has to settle into and through the grounds after they ""bloom."" Once full, you set it aside roughly overnight, then open the air vent, release the fill valve, and delicioso cold brew drains into the carafe which you can then put in the fridge to chill.

The top portion dismantles and can be practically rinsed out under warm water for next use. Soap hardly needed (maybe once a week). The carafe cleans quite easily with an OXO or similar brand soft nylon bottle brush. Take especial care of the gaskets ... one fell out during unpacking, it was very simple to put back in place. Don't overtighten and I'm sure they'll last a long time. The more expensive models may offer convenience, but frankly, this is like making ice tea or lemonade, it's not rocket surgery. If the output isn't enough for your household, you can buy two for the same amount of money of a fancier ""automatic"" model that perhaps doesn't make that much more. I might even do that if I switch to cold brew every day for the summer months (idea!). The all-black model looks very sleek and cool IMHO.

Based on performance and taste, I bought a second maker in copper (and it briefly came with a pour spout top), and bought another for my daughter Christmas. With a second carafe, I can have a batch chilled in the fridge and make a fresh batch at the same time. I don't know if the replacement carafes come with a lid, but if they do that would be an economical enhancement.",D.B. Spalding,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de enero de 2021

Just a few things I am not crazy about with the design. It’s really tall so it only first on one specific side shelf in my fridge, so if you have a small fridge you might have problems there.
The part where the coffee pours into is advertised as a travel cup but it is so big that I can not hold it with one hand. I always have to pour the cold brew in another cup which is fine.
I do love the filter it comes with. Other cold brew makers have made my coffee have crumbs/coffee grounds but this cold brew is so smooth, the filter is great and I never get any muck in my coffee.

Company tried to steal my money.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This thing sucked and the company sucks too. Reasons why below:

- Some coffee grinds seeped through despite being coarse. Gross.

- Comes in lots of pieces and very cumbersome to use/handle. Annoying to clean.

- Design is flawed: the cup part is vacuum insulated.. but it takes 12+ goes to make coffee.. The problem is it's so big, you can't keep it assembled in the fridge. So by the time it's done, your coffee is lukewarm. So why do you need the insulation? You can put ice on it, but it's alot of coffee to drink in a day (for me anyways).

- Worst offense: company started that it had free returns, meaning if i was unsatisfied, if get my money back. Guess what? They charged me a restocking fee of 20% after I sent it back. Utter garbage. Good thing amazon took care of me. Never buying from this company again.",Mystery,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de marzo de 2020

Heavenly flavor - simple to use - Great company to deal with,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I initially purchased this because I’m always interested in coffee tasting better. I must admit that when I first started using I was frustrated by the change in routine to creating coffee a day in advance and wasn’t sure that the difference was worth it. And I stopped using it for a couple of months.

Then I considered getting rid of it because I wasn’t using it and I decided to try it again.

I think what really stopped me from using it is that I really don’t like cold coffee, first thing in the morning, and I was comparing that to the hot coffee I had been drinking. But on a whim, I decided to microwave heat the coffee after the 24 hours of brewing, after I poured it into a cup. Takes exactly 2 minutes. Just to see what it was like.

I’m not sure why I missed doing this the first time around, but there’s no comparison in the flavor when you brew with boiled water vs with cold water then heated 24 hours later. The difference seems to be that the acidic citrusy flavor which I don’t like in coffee is gone with this appliance. Now I can’t even imagine wanting coffee where I boiled the water to brew it. And the funny thing is, that until I tasted of the difference, I didn’t even realize how acidic the hot-brewed coffee tasted.

One last thing that’s worth mentioning. I inadvertently messed up part of this machine. Perhaps there was a defect. I’m not sure. But I suspect it was user error. And I contacted the company to find out how to replace a part that I admitted to them I messed up. All I can say is their response was quick and amazing, from an apologetic email I sent them.

Also I initially hesitated to purchase because I saw reviews of people complained about leaks, a clogged photo or whatever. I can tell you that I never have a leak issue and I simply loosely tighten the container And I never have a clogged filter, but of course, I use the course grains that they say to use; I suspect the fine ones are the problem when people do that. And maybe they’re not properly cleaning this filter, as I do it after every use with the supply brush and sometimes sponge.

So you can imagine, I feel I made the right choice. And I want other people to know. Which is why I decided to write this review.",Michael Koren,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de septiembre de 2019

Great for saving money on iced coffee from major chains,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Summers where I live are unbearably hot and humid, and I drink an ocean of cold brew and iced coffee. Sure, it's great to have the convenience of grabbing one from a major coffee chain, but that indulgence can quickly add up.

So I was happy to have the chance to try out the Asobu Portable Cold Brew Coffee Maker. It's a coldbrew maker and an insulated carafe all in once, which is nice. The build seems sturdy and mine has held up well. The design is very sleek as well, and the matte black finish is unobtrusive.

I keep my Asobu at my desk at work; you simply add any standard-grind drip coffee to the metal mesh filter, pour water over in a circular motion, and let steep. The mesh is fine enough prevent coffee granules from slipping through and falling into the coffee, which is nice. It's important to add the coffee grounds in stages; you add the first third, wet thoroughly, then continue to add grounds and water, finally pouring cold filtered water over the top.

When the coffee is finished brewing in 12-24 hours depending on how strong you like it (you can pop it into the fridge overnight), you simply press the button to drain into the insulated carafe (which comes with a spillproof lid), add ice, and you're good to go!

The bad: It's rather large (technically it IS portable, but this is not something you could transport easily while in a car, etc.; as others have mentioned, it does tend to leak and there are issues with the fine mesh filter). As with any homemade cold brew, it's not fast...but you get several servings from one carafe, and over the long run the Asobu has saved me a lot of money as an iced coldbrew from a major coffee chain can easily run $4 a cup.

It's a great solution if you you have the time and counter / fridge space to make ahead, but does require some advance planning.",Kumiko,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de diciembre de 2018

The only downside I noticed was that one of the rubber rings that keeps the brewer from leaking is slightly torn... so far no issues with that but you do have to remove them to clean underneath.

Great product. Would buy a 2nd one.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought this for the hubs as a Father's Day gift. Offered next day shipping. It arrived on time, in its own packaging, in great condition. The hubs loved it. He washed it and used it right away. The convenience of it being attached to the carafe is great. Easy usage. We had no leaks no spills. It does need to steep 12-24 hours. It uses 3c of h2o per brew. Plenty of room in carafe to brew maybe 2xs but leave room for ice/cream if you plan to take it on-the-go. We steeped overnight (5pm-5am) for morning coffee to take to his work. We used reg coffee grounds (starbucks, donut shop/dunkin donut brand) Doesn't take up much space, brew in room temperature. Easy clean up. The carafe keeps the coffee very cold, once ice is added. It comes with instructions but we watched the YouTube video. Wish this came with a larger capacity brewer. I am thinkg of orderg another just to have to make more at the same time if needed. This was perfect for us. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5 stars.",JessieGirl74,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de julio de 2018

"Large, premium feeling product which produces a lovely cold brew","5,0 de 5 estrellas","As the children have grown up, they have started to like an iced latte and so far have used a shot of espresso from the De'Longhi bean to cup machine that is in daily use, along with some milk, and a shot of Monin syrup. I read about the taste differences of a cold-brew coffee and was keen to get one.
Even from the packaging, everything about this feels like a premium product. I would happily give this as a gift. Opening it up reveals the device itself; larger than expected and made of pleasingly tactile materials throughout. It is attractive looking and sits comfortably within the 'coffee corner' of our kitchen.

The actual operation is very simple. Coarsely grind some beans, add slowly with some water to the filter, and then leave on the side for 12 hours. I saw on one review that it doesn't sit in a standard fridge with the insulated collection pot attached but the instructions say to steep the coffee at room temperature and so the main bit of the device has never been in our fridge.

Once brewed, there is a push button mechanism to release the coffee into the insulated carafe which then separates and you can pop on the lid. Cleaning the minimal parts of the main device is then very simple with warm running water. If you have a high demand for cold brew coffee, you could immediately begin another brew whilst the first carafe is in the fridge but we have never required this level of output. There is a niggly doubt in my mind that this is over-engineered and too much form over function; is there really any benefit to this mechanism rather than creating cold brew in a specifically designed pot and then transferring it to a storage vessel? I don't know the answer to that but as long as it doesn't break and continues doing it's job, I do like the pleasing showmanship of the coffee release!

The resultant drink is smooth and less bitter than a regular espresso and the carafe sits comfortably in the fridge for whoever next requires some. We did a taste test between a refrigerated shot of espresso and the resultant product from this device using the same beans, and the difference is quite noticeable. I would argue that it is less so by the time you have dumped milk and a syrup shot or two into the glass but hey, it keeps everyone happy and so who am I to argue? It hasn't replaced my morning shot of regular espresso but (as a non-milk drinker), I do enjoy the versatility of being able to have it as a short cold drink, or add some ice and water and maybe some syrup to make a longer drink. It has also gone down very well when mixed with some Kahlua, vodka, and a shot of syrup to create an espresso martini.

All in all, a very good product that I'm pleased I bought.",CBS,Revisado en Reino Unido el 25 de enero de 2023

The Cold brewer is very sharp looking and looks good on the kitchen counter. In trying it I found that it is simple to use. In the evening I put the coffee and the water in and then put it in my refrigerator. The next morning I took it out and pressed the little button on the center piece. You have to hold it for about 15 seconds to drain out all of the ""Cold Brewed Coffee"" into the bottom. I added some milk and sweetner and took the bottom (which is a stainless steel insulated bottle with a cap) to work. My coffee was still cold at 3pm when I finally finished it.

"Great Customer Service, great product.","5,0 de 5 estrellas","Great product and great customer service. Having used my brewer for a couple of weeks, I started to experience the ""Lid Spin"" issue described by a few others. I sent an e-mail to the company and got a very quick reply stating that as soon as I provide my address a new lid was on the way, free of charge. Pretty fantastic when a company does this without question.

On top of the great support, the coffee is very good. It takes a couple of brews to get things dialed in perfectly for your personal tastes, but after a few tries I know exactly how much coffee to use, how long to brew in the fridge, and I get a much better cop of iced coffee than I can buy at any store. I would definitely recommend this for anybody that enjoys a nice cup of cold brewed coffee.

"Big Promises, Disappointing Results.","3,0 de 5 estrellas","The coffee maker is simple enough - put in some coffee grounds, pour water over them, and allow it to steep for 12-24 hours at room temperature. There is nothing fancy or complicated about the coffee maker itself - it only has the one button that you press to release the coffee into the carafe. My main issue with this coffee maker is that the button is very hard to push, and you have to hold it down until all of the coffee has poured into the carafe. Once it stopped dripping, I noticed there was still a small amount of coffee at the bottom of the brewing compartment - it did not drain 100% of the coffee into the carafe. I used Starbucks' Narino 70 cold brew coffee for this experiment because I've tasted it before and I don't like it. Since this coffee maker claims to brew coffee without the ""diluted, bitter, and acidic standard"" taste of iced coffee, I figured it was worth a try - maybe it would be less bitter and acidic. Unfortunately, the coffee tasted exactly the same as it tastes when I've ordered it at Starbucks in the past. To be honest, I kind of feel like the claims regarding what this coffee maker can do are somewhat exaggerated; however, if I can get my hands on another brand of ground coffee, I'd be willing to try it again.",Lauren V,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de noviembre de 2017
"Sleek, stylish cold brew coffee maker","4,0 de 5 estrellas","The Asobu portable coffeemaker for cold coffee is beautiful to look at, but the design at times is sacrificed for beauty rather than practicality.

When I opened the box this coffee maker came in, I immediately noticed how pretty it looked. The coffee maker comes in a round container and when opened the coffee maker looks exactly as pictured in the Amazon.com advertisement. The coffeemaker is in a symmetrical hour glass shape, and would look incredible in the kitchen, office or dormitory. Overall, this product is easy to use-I brew the coffee and normally serve it 24 hours afterwards, not the 12 to 18 hours the directions explain. This is very easy to clean.

Why the four stars rather than five? The only reason I have to grade down one star is due to the lever on the air release valve (to drain the coffee from the brewing chamber into the carafe). Basically, you have to really, REALLY press the button hard, and it drains slowly, so you have to hold it a long time to drain the coffee out. It's not entirely obvious how you push the button either, you have to push the bottom in which you will figure out the first time you use it. It seems this part could have been designed to have been used a little easier, as I don't know if the button will hold up to repeated uses. This is a shame, because the way my coffee tasted (Biggby coffee Creme Brûlée blend) was incredible, silky and yummy overall. Also, you know you don't have to have this coffee cold-you can heat it up in the microwave after you brew it. With the cold brewing process, the bitterness comes right out of your coffee and you are left with satin to drink instead. Incredible! The coffee afterwards was well worth the inconvenience of waiting (one day) and pressing the inconvenient release button valve. Also, it doesn't make a tremendous amount of coffee-two to three cups worth, depending on the size of your cup.

I do recommend this product, and I would buy a redesigned version of this product for people who want more than two to three cups of coffee, and who don't want to damage their fingers by pressing the valve release button excessively to release the coffee.",L.

portable,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Like most: the design. It is cool. I like that you can take the cup out and place a lid on it to keep it warm or cold. I like that you can hold the coffee in the top part and then deposit into the carafe.
Like least: clumsy design... I felt like I was about to drop it a couple of times... It is not shaped to carry... Takes 12-24 hours to brew coffee.. Very disappointing for me and my co-workers.

UPDATE: My co-worker and I did try this and it did not take 12 hours to brew the coffee. It also did not leak. She loved the coffee and the taste was great only after 4 hours. It was very easy to use and empty into the holder. She did have to bring a coffee cup and microwave it. She loved it. We will be using it again.

I received this for my honest opinion and was not compensated.",CHRISTINA,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de diciembre de 2017
"works fine, button is hard to press. No leaks.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","It works fine, but might use some improvement.
I tried brewing both tea and coffee in it. Tea I did not like at all, but coffee was quite good. Tea came out too bitter and probably simply needed time adjustment. I did not have this problem with coffee, although I liked the coffee better when it was brewed closer to 12-15 hours, not 24.
The metal cone that holds coffee grounds is perforated steel on the outside, but it is lined with fine wire mesh on the inside. It holds lots of coffee and makes quite large portion.
The clear portion of the thing that holds water is plastic. On the bottom of it, there is a ball valve that keeps the coffee in the upper chamber. When you press the button, you lift the ball with a tiny plastic lever, and coffee slowly pours down into the carafe. It does not drip if you put it on the counter without carafe, so the valve is great, but pressing the button for that long is not so much. It is a tight button and you need to press firmly and continuously. The little lever looks fragile, and I am not sure how long this thing will last. I don't know if it replaceable.
Keep in mind that you are pouring fresh cold water into it, not boiling, so there is a potential for contamination and it is a bad idea to make the coffee stay in there for more than 24 hours.",Ann,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de noviembre de 2017

"Attractive, functional, easy to clean","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I'll start with what I don't like about this, which is a short and pretty minor list.

First, the picture is a little misleading. It looked like there's two carafe provided. But there's only one, so unfortunately you can't drink from one while brewing your next batch.

The brewing carafe is made of Tritan. I think glass would have been nicer, especially when using hot water (since the manufacturer advertises it as suitable for hot tea and coffee as well).

Finally, there's a silicone ring around the stainless steel mesh cone. I'm not sure if I'm doing it wrong, but there appears to be only one way to put it on. It's not mentioned in the instructions. But with the silicone ring on, when I unscrew the top cap of the brewing carafe, it lifts the cone up as well, and because there's not much grip on the cone, it takes a bit of wriggling to separate it from the top cap. And speaking of grip, there's not much grip on the top cap too. Even with large hands, it was a little hard getting a good grip to unscrew it. A more grippy material or some texture for additional grip would be nice. I'll probably put a thick rubber band around it for more grip.

In use, it's pretty straightforward. It takes a bit of time to fill since you have to wait for the water to seep through the ground into the brewing carafe, but there's not much to it. Fill some coffee ground, pour some water, repeat until you've filled it with coffee ground and water, then screw it on and wait 24 hours. It's my first time making cold brew coffee, and my ground is probably a little too fine, but it came out tasting great anyway.

I was surprised at how much more ground coffee is required to make an equivalent amount of coffee compared to drip coffee. According to the instructions, you need 2 - 3 oz of coffee. 3 oz just about fills the entire cone, so if you don't have to weigh it.

The bottom carafe has a nice matte finish, and is spill proof when closed properly (it passed the upside down shake test).

Cleaning is easy. It needs to be hand washed, but a simple soaping and rinsing and it looks just like new. If you need to scrub the stainless steel carafe, I recommend OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush , unless you have really small hands.

Overall, a really nice looking cold brew coffee maker that works well, and it can be used to make hot tea or pour-over coffee as well. Comes packed in a cardboard cylinder that should be easy to wrap - thought I'd mention that since I'm writing this during Christmas shopping season.",Lenny,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de noviembre de 2017
"Great, tasty cold brew, easy and fun and cool looking.","5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a coffee maker for people who are truly seriously in love with their coffee. I always make more than I drink in the morning when I make coffee. I usually use a ""Melitta"" drip/pour over style and I grind my beans fresh every time I brew. I consider myself a total coffee freak. First let me say that it is now a ""thing"" to have cold brew. That means brewing the coffee slowly in plain (they recommend filtered) water not heated. So the course-filtered coffee takes 24 or more hours to brew. The reason is supposedly less bitter taste and a cleaner, fresher real coffee flavor. The brewer comes in a cool package, a tube with the entire machine basically intact. The instructions are neatly ""hidden"" in the filter area. After cleaning, I ground some medium roasted beans that were slightly on the lighter side. I put the ground coffee in the metal cone, poured 3 cups of water into the top, and let it sit for 30 hours. Then there is a button you hold while the filtered coffee goes down to the handy large ""mug"" insulated bottle that is on the bottom. The verdict? A very clean, non-bitter brew that was delicious without adding any sugar, milk or ice to it. It was light, since I knew using the lighter beans would make it more mild, but the flavor comes through. Drinking directly from the bottle, which comes with a very good, tight cap, was easy and no ""dribble"" from the bottle. I did notice a little coffee dripping down the side when I put the cap back on. The insulation in the bottle is rated at 24 hours on the instructions cold, 12 hours hot. The bottle, although wide and no way going to fit in a car cup holder, is wide enough not to spill over easily and the metal paint texture of it prevents slipping out of your hands. Cleaning is easy, rinse everything out and start again.

Excellent Cold Brew Coffee!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The Asobu Cold Brew Coffee Maker is easy to operate and to clean and it makes delicious cold brewed iced coffee! The directions state to alternate adding the ground coffee and water in three stages but I found a YouTube video of the inventor adding the coffee in all at once, pouring the 3 cups of water and then gently stirring the coffee grounds to ensure that it was well mixed. Tried this method and it worked well and was easier than what the directions stated. The 3 cups of water makes enough coffee to fill the carafe half way which is about 2 large iced coffees. I'm assuming the rest of the space in the carafe was meant to leave room for ice cubes if desired. I also tried to microwave the cold brew as well to make a cup of hot coffee. It was okay but a bit on the strong side. I would use less coffee grounds when intending to make hot coffee. The price is a bit steep for such a simple mechanism (really just a metal mesh coffee filter with a valve positioned over a stainless steel carafe) but highly recommend this for the convenience, ease and taste of the iced coffee this device makes.",An Educated Consumer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de noviembre de 2017
Oh so good,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I’ve recently learned that I like, “really, really, like” iced coffee. In the past I was not a fan due to the fact that I never had the real thing. This brewer does it perfectly. The results are not diluted, not acidic, and not bitter. What you get is a pure coffee taste that you can drink black or dress up with milk or sugar, or as I do with a dash of flavored creamer.

The process is simple. You put 1.3 OZ of coffee in the mesh strainer. For me that’s about 8TB of beans before I coarse grind them. You then pour 3 coups of good filtered water over the beans and let this mixture sit for 12 hours. I do it in the evening so I have coffee for the next day. Yes, there is no “instant gratification” but it’s so worth the wait. Then, All you need to do is press the button on the front of the unit and the water drips into the waiting jug below.

The unit comes with a nice insulated carafe that is portable though I like to keep mine in the fridge to use during the day. I simply pour the coffee over ice in a glass and then add my whitener. Clean up is about the same as you’d have in a French Press. The whole unit looks nifty and a bit futuristic.

A touch complicated to actually use, do a dry run with plain water first. Learn that the top has a rubber switch that allows air to flow to break the vacuum. You will need that bit of knowledge later! lol About three ounces of dry beans, ground, will yield three cups of midnight cold fuel.

Good Things Come To Those Who Wait,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I can't often say that I actually love a product but I have come to love this Asobu Coldbrew Portable Cold Brew Coffee Maker With a Vacuum Insulated 40oz Stainless Steel 18/8 Carafe. This cold brew coffee maker has introduced me to the world of coffee made without heat. I have often chilled coffee after making it with hot water.

Also, those components of coffee with health benefits are preserved in the cold brew process. This is a very easy coffee brewer to use. Don't expect to wake up and make morning coffee though. The cold brew process takes from twelve to twenty four hours so you must plan ahead. Never has the saying, ""Good things come to those who wait"" been more apt. In the instantaneous world that we live in, the best things still take time. I recommend starting a batch in the evening to ready in the morning. I would also like to mention that I had some questions about this cold brewer and the vendor was very responsive and helpful.",Moderate Risk,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de noviembre de 2017
So much better than my old french press!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This thing blows my old method of a french press out of the water! It's simple to use, you fill the grounds basket with coffee just like you would a pot and then fill it up with cold water. Let it sit overnight or for a full day and then press the button and it fills up the container. If you want cold coffee let it sit in the fridge while it steeps. If you want it really cold you put ice in the reservoir first. You can also do a partial cup so a cup now and leave the rest steeping! So... what are the draw backs you ask? Well... not many really. The button is a bit hard to press, but it's not that bad and I love the try a bit and see if it's strong enough option. The wire mesh is a bit hard to get 100% clean, but it's doable. I think the worst part is getting the top seal set up after cleaning, but even if you mess that up it's not going to leak from that seal so again, not that bad. I've had no leaks and it's easy to know which piece goes where. This thing is awesome!",K. Miller,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de noviembre de 2017
Looks and Works Beautifully,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Aesthetically the coffee maker and packaging are beautiful. This is the kind of thing you'd be proud to give as a gift. The unit itself (especially the carafe) is nicely textured and the whole thing looks great sitting on the counter.

Functionally this cold-brew coffee maker works superbly. It is solid, leak-proof, and everything fits and works logically. The instructions are brief but clear. The only potential gotcha is that you have to remember to open the small air plug in the top of the unit before transferring the brewed coffee to the carafe.

The cold brew coffee this unit produced tasted amazing. I'm not ready to give up my hot pour-over coffee just yet (especially with winter coming), but cold brew coffee is a nice change once in a while and I know I will get a lot of use out of this coffee maker.

The only thing I disliked is that all of the pieces have to be hand washed and there are a lot of pieces: carafe, brewing chamber, the ""bridge"" between the two, the metal filter, and two caps.

All in all this is a great cold-brew coffee maker. I'm glad I have one for myself, and I am likely going to be purchasing a couple of more to give as gifts to my coffee-drinking friends. I'm sure they will be impressed.",Wing,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de noviembre de 2017
Excellent for delicious cold brew or fresh cold tea,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a lifesaver for someone who was making homemade cold brew every week. . I have used this constantly over the last month as my husband loves cold brew and I love cold chai tea. This product does both with ease. For those of you who used to do it manually, this is like a dream. The messiness of just filtering has saved me at least an hour. At first I thought the price was a bit high, but when I compared what you get with this cold brew system vs what's out there, it is very competitive. I love that the mug stays cold for 24 hours, or hot for 12 hours. You can also easily substitute tea for coffee if that's what you like and you can also make it much stronger so it lasts longer, which is what we do. This comes in a great round box that would also be a great gift for someone who loves cold brew or bright fresh cold tea. Fantastic product.",Joe Baker,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de noviembre de 2017
excellent all around,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","In a word, fantastic.

We've been using the Asobu Coldbrew for a couple of weeks now and we love it.

It's functional, looks great, and most importantly, makes a great cup of Joe.

Clean up is a breeze, too! And that fact that its portable is an added bonus.

The only thing we would recommend would be a glass version instead of plastic, in case someone wanted to make a regular hot brew.",Matt,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de noviembre de 2017
