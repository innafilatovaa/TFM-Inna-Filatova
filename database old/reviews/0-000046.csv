Ruido eléctrico,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","El acabado del mango deja bastante que desear para un producto tan caro. La base hacía un ruido extraño al enchufarla, sin siquiera encenderla. Se fue de vuelta a amazon antes de llegar a probarla",Abel,Revisado en España el 16 de febrero de 2022
Fellow es lamentable,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Le doy una estrella porque no se si no se le puede dar ninguna. No he comprado este producto en Amazon. Pero es la fellow kettle stag. Solo quiero compartir que no merece la pena ese dinero por una tetera. Nada más abrirla le fallaba el display mostrando la temperatura solo en F y no en C. Y tampoco alcanza la temperatura maxima. Después de pasarme un mes de emails y vídeos con el servicio técnico de Fellow, confirmaron que tendrían que cambiarme la base y al pasarle mis datos personales me contestaron que solo cubren USA y Canada y que me busque la vida con el distribuidor donde lo compré.

Ah y al primer uso ya le salen como puntitos blancos dentro si no lo limpias meticulosamente tras cada uso...

Un mes perdido, casi 200€ menos y todo por tener un simple aparato que hierve agua pero no da ninguna de las características que dice tener. Repito esto no ha sido comprado en Amazon ni en este vendedor, pero es la marca Fellow la que para mi no merece ni un euro de vuestros bolsillos.

Me molesto en poner esta reseña para que nadie caiga en engaños, no sé por que tiene tantas estrellas cuando nos ha dado tantos fallos a tanta gente...",Alejandra C.S.,Revisado en España el 22 de enero de 2021
Muy buen hervidor para V60... mientras funciona,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Ha funcionado perfectamente hasta el tercer mes después de la compra, cuando el control del a temperatura se ha vuelto loco, saltando en milisegundos de 87 a 99 a 90, por ejemplo, y no haciendo ni caso de la temperatura seleccionada con ""hold"" (programaba para mantener una temperatura de 94 ºC y se pasaba a 97 ºC

Ya es bastante malo que un hervidor de este precio dure 3 meses, pero es que para colmo no hay servicio técnico en España, por lo que he tenido que enviarlo a Francia para que lo arreglen ¡y me dicen que tardará como un mes!

Eso sí, la comunicación con el vendedor ha sido muy buena y me ha remitido una etiqueta pre-pagada para que no me cueste el envío.",eleme,Revisado en España el 11 de marzo de 2020
Bad controls can leave kettle heating after water evaporates,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","In general, I like this kettle. It initially did a good job of heating to a setpoint. It has a timer which is nice, but also a problem. There is only a single button on the kettle, it controls both on/off and, when held for a few seconds, activates the timer. The issue is when you select it to turn it off, after the timer is running, it only disables the timer, but the kettle still heats. There is no safety shutoff, so when the water evaporates or is boiled off, it continues to heat. This damages the heat sensor and it no longer maintains temperature. This is surprisingly easy to do and, for that reason, I believe it is a design flaw. Timer control and kettle on/off should be different controls.",Wendi Hagood,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de julio de 2024
"Great for 3 years, then RIP","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Not as durable as multiple cheaper electric kettles I've bought over the last 15 years....but really nice to use, fast to heat, accurate temps for finicky teas, just the right size. Rather sudden deterioration in temp control, started boiling regardless of set temp, not shutting off heating even at full boil. Recommended decalcination protocol appeared successful based on shiny clean metal appearance, but temp inaccuracy continued (or resumed, went through a week or two of mostly teas best infused with water at the boil). Not sure if it can be saved--have submitted a request to Fellow support--and not sure I will replace it with another one if it can't be saved.",Diane in Los Angeles,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de julio de 2024

Poorly designed and dangerous,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Yeah it holds the corect temperature, but the steam holes burn your hand when you take the lid off to refill it (which you need to do frequently because it doesn't hold that much water - or to check the water level since you can't see from the outside). The hold feature is on by default, but you're not supposed to let it run dry (but you can't tell from the outside). If you turn the hold feature off, the screen is still on and it seems to boil anyway. The dial is cute, but switching beween 175 and 212 frequently without presets is annoying. It doesn't notify you when it reaches temp. It pours SLOWLY and is too small to brew and 8 cup chemex.",Moonwind,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de abril de 2024

Beautiful but there are issues.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this for my wife for X-Mas. She had been asking me for a good electric kettle and this one seemed like it fit the bill.
With the first use we noticed that even though we had filled it below the max fill line water still bubbled up out of the top. You have to be very careful as the water gets heated to 212 degrees. There have been a few occasions where the water has burned us.
It got to the point where we both got pretty annoyed with it. I went to return it and I missed the window by two days.
In my opinion this is not worth the money. We have burned ourselves on multiple occasions. You have to get a paper towel and make sure all the water on the lid is completely gone before pouring.
Also because of the holes on the top water literally shoots out and gets all over the surrounding area. Oh and sometimes the lid starts to pop off. Honestly I am surprised there hasn’t been a recall on this.
I do NOT recommend.",Ben Blume,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de febrero de 2024
Melting Plastic Odor/Abysmal Customer Service,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I love the smell of coffee brewing in the morning. If you do too, I would look elsewhere.

Customer Service said smell would go away with use. Has not. Have tried replacing kettle multiple times to no avail. Fellow is not willing to refund (high) cost of the kettle as it was purchased from Amazon, but dragged their feet and trying to resolve the issues so I’m outside of Amazon’s return period.

Mostly Good - But Poor... Slowly,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Yes, I know it's ""Pour""... but ""Poor"" seemed more fitting. We do like this kettle. It has worked well for us and hasn't had any of the glitches others have reported. It heats water to a precise temperature fairly quickly and also looks great. However, the pour rate is incredibly slow if you don't want water on your counter. We have tried just about everything to prevent the water from leaking or wicking back down the kettle, but nothing works. Except pouring extremely slowly. This may be a feature of all gooseneck kettles, but this is the only one we've had. Also, I think it would be good to have an audible beep when it reaches the desired temp so you can step away while it's heating. Otherwise, nice kettle. They now offer a non-gooseneck version, and although I like the look of ours, I think I'd opt for the other one just to avoid spillage.",Keith Raker,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de febrero de 2024
Beautiful but very slow pour rate,"3,0 de 5 estrellas",This is a beautifully made gooseneck kettle. The temp setting dial is simple and easy to use. There are no bells and whistles despite the high price but I was ok with that given the unreliability of a cheaper brand that I tried twice before giving up. Unfortunately much as I wanted to love this kettle I did not have the patience to stick with it as the pour rate is incredibly slow. I could literally feel myself aging as I stood pouring!

"Works well, and Fellow is easy to interact with if you have problems","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've had this as my primary kettle for 2 years. Works well and is easy to use. Fellow was also great to deal with when I had a problem: The dial button (to turn it on and off) started getting more and more flaky (sometimes it would take 2 or 3 presses to turn the kettle on or off); I contacted Fellow support, and they walked me through figuring out the exact revision of the base, then sent me a replacement for free. The new one works great. I'm still enjoying this kettle.

It is a pour-over style kettle, so it'll take a little while longer fill up a large mug or a french press than a typical kettle would. That's not a downside for me, though -- it's a great opportunity to take a few deep breaths. Then I enjoy my coffee/tea that much more!",Michael J.

The king of gooseneck kettles…,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","After extensive research of gooseneck kettles for my pour over coffee, I continued to see the Fellow EKG pop up time and time again as the top of the line kettle for making coffee. I continued researching, but couldn’t get it out of the back of my mind even after being dissuaded by the price. I took a plunge, and it was worth every dollar. The counterbalance in the handle along with the shape makes it feel like it melts into my hand. It holds the temperature of my water extremely proficiently. It doesn’t have any weird and annoying beeps (which is such a huge positive).

Broken because of major design flaw,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this kettle, it's beautiful and works well except for one major design flaw. Whenever it get's unplugged it defaults back to it's highest temperature setting which makes the water boil and overflow out of the kettle. This happened a couple of times so we were cautious about it and then our power went out and after turning the kettle on and walking away not realizing it had been reset with the power outage it overflowed and soaked the entire unit. It didn't work for a few days so we assumed it was lost, but then we realized it was still heating the water but the small screen that displays the timer and temp is broken.

Die Station hat eine Gummisohle, sodass wenn man den Kocher draufstellt, es nicht klappert und sich insgesamt angenehm anfühlt.

Nach dem Auspacken wird die Temperatur in °F angezeigt. Man könnte meinen, dass die Temperatureinheit sich mit dem Drehregler einstellen lässt. Es gibt allerdings noch einen mechanischen Schalter auf der Rückseite, mit dem man auf °C umstellen kann.

Temperature controlling function does not measure temperature accurately. Be careful : 1. Don’t try to speed up the watering speed, water will pour out of the lid 2.

"It won’t last, but it looks cool.","3,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a beautiful kettle. I’ve used it off and on for a few years, it typically performs great, however…

One huge concern, is the safety, mine has boiled over a lot. Not always, but it does happen. Doesn’t matter if it’s at the full line or just below, it will spurt out boiling water on the counter and your hands when you try and turn it off or take it off the heating element. I’ve dealt with this, because it still looked cool and the pour is very precise.

Eventually, the handy temperature digital screen faded and I no longer am able to be precise with the water temp. Also, if you use the timer, that’ll be gone too.

Look, it’s a nice looking kettle and I wish I could buy it again, but for the price and limited time that it will work, it’s probably better to shop around.

Or just know the life of this kettle may be limited and maybe you do want to buy one every few years? Also, you may get burned.

OXO, had it as well executed in an elegant way with the display in the knob. I can't speak about temp accuracy because I haven't tested it but there are tons of videos online with kettle pissing contests. I don't like how I have to press the button multiple times for a successful contact - both turning it ON and OFF. Another thing that I don't like is that this kettle is SLOW....it feels very slow....come on the coffee is done roasting and I ironed my shirt already and changed the oil on the car. The third thing I don't like is the inside diameter of the spout.

Perfect Pour Over Kettle- Almost,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The kettle is primarily used for pour-over coffee and various types of teas, so the adjustable temperature is very important. The temperature setting is very accurate as I have tested it across of range of temperatures to see if it varies- it did not. Also, the 0.9 liter capacity is preferred to prepare multiple cups. The quality of design and materials is very good- you can feel it is heavier, and the design was well-thought through. The only thing that should be improved is the addition of a sound/signal to indicate the water has reached the intended temperature, and when the ""hold"" function turns off. After having other kettles that have that function, I really miss it.",GoodyRuns,Revisado en Alemania el 15 de septiembre de 2023

Go directly to the source for this one,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The Stagg EKG Kettle: a story in three parts.

1. I ordered the kettle from Amazon. It was ludicrously spendy for me, but so beautiful. Nothing else on the market comes close. And given the repeated heat waves in the Northeast this summer, I wanted a kettle that could heat my water for coffee without adding heat to the house. When it finally arrived, I unpacked it, ooohed and aahhed at the beauty, added water, plugged it in and.... nothing. No LCD, no heating, simply.. nothing. Sighing heavily, I assumed it was an anomaly and sent it back. I ordered a replacement version that same day.

2. Take two: a few days later, the second Stagg kettle arrives from Amazon. Unpack, plug it in.... aaaaand nothing. Double check the plug, move it to different outlets, reset said outlets - finally, for reasons unbeknownst to me, the LCD lights up with ""Fellows."" But nothing further. (I've now hit the ""on"" button about a zillion times). So, in frustration I tweet, Facebook IM and send a message the Fellows Support folks on their website.

The Fellows customer service rep got back to me within the hour, ***from his vacation*** to help me out. Said that definitely shouldn't be happening and said, ""Please let me send you one directly from our warehouse."" Asked for the Amazon order numbers, as he thought perhaps there is something in Amazon's handling that is affecting performance of the kettle.

In the meantime, I've gotten Kettle #2 to actually heat water to the boiling point once (on the 100th try or so), so I message the CSR back and say ""Maybe it's working?"" Next attempt? The LCD said ""no water"" and refused to do anything. Back it goes. I returned to the CSR and requested a kettle direct from Fellows: I was happy to pay for a replacement kettle, but he insisted on sending it free of charge to compensate for my hassle.

3. EUREKA! The third-time's-a-charm kettle arrived about 3 weeks ago. It has worked like a charm ever since the first minute. Heats like a dream, quickly, efficiently. Holds the temperature accurately to about 1 degree. Pours easily, smoothly and effortlessly. My husband (who initially scoffed at the price) is increasingly enamored of this kettle, and says frequently (sheepishly) how much he loves it. It is everything all of the 5-star reviews say and more.

So, finally although I've had very good luck with Amazon over the years, my advice to you on this one is: go directly to the source. You won't regret it. And a very huge shoutout to Fellows support for A++ customer service!",k.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de septiembre de 2018
Almost perfect,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","There are many reviews for Stag EKG. What I am sharing is my experience of the unit I received.

The packaging was good, but I felt the unit was opened, as the outer brown box was re-sealed and the box inside it did not have any temper-evident seals/stickers. But everything seemed to be kept well, including the fellow sticker.

This unit comes with a schuko plug, if you want to ground it properly you need to buy an adaptor.

It is built well but the plastic parts seemed to be a little inferior in quality.

Its usable capacity for me was around 750 mL, because when the water boils it spurts out through the steam vents. This is not a big deal for me as I use it for pour over only.

It has a restricted flow that is helpful for pour over, but can be frustrating if you want to quickly empty the kettle.

The major pain for me in using the kettle, like many reported, is the unreliable power on button. You may need to press it a couple of times to get it on; at times, it will work in the first attempt itself.

The flow dynamics seems perfect for my requirement, it is easy to switch between the laminar and turbulent flow by changing the height a little.

Good temperature-controlled kettle with a few quirks,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I chose this kettle primarily for my Gong Fu tea sessions as the temperature control is one of the most important brewing parameters and I've heard this kettle is very good in that department. Having used this kettle on a daily basis for a year I can definitely confirm that the temperature control is excellent.

I like that:
1. Temperature control is almost perfect (except missing shortcut to boiling point, see below).
2. Overall ergonomics are great. The balance of the weight distribution while pouring is superb and pouring feels just natural and precise. The one turn/click button for setting the temperature and starting/stopping the kettle is an excellent UX.
3. Occasionally brewing Gyokuro I need the temperature as low as 50 °C and this kettle allows such a low temperature setting.

However there are few annoying quirks this kettle has:
1. The manufacturer is slacking in QC. My first unit had defective Fahrenheit/Celsius switch, fortunately Amazon replaced it and this one has the electronics in order. From what I've read it's not uncommon to get a defective base.
2. With use the plastic part of the lid warps a little and then it happens that the two pieces of the lid rotate and the venting holes get misaligned. One has to pay attention to that.
3. (Near-)boiling a full kettle causes that drops of water occasionally sputter through the lid venting holes and one can get burned. Also, one has to train not to touch the metal part of the handle as it gets really hot; with regular use I rarely burn myself anymore though.
4. When the temperature is set to boiling point the kettle still slows down several degrees ahead of reaching it and tries to get there slowly not to overshoot the temperature. For boiling point setting there is no reason for the sophisticated temperature control and no need to slow down.
5. The viewing angle of the display could be better. One has to be relatively close to be able to read it.
6. I would appreciate some discreet beep once the kettle reaches the set temperature the first time. Ideally to be enabled/disabled by a third switch at the back of the base though that might be a little too much to ask for :-)
7. For my use case the pouring speed is just too slow. If I want to brew in a larger (200 ml) teapot it takes way too long to fill it. I would love to be able to control the speed of the pour by tilting the kettle a bit more but the gooseneck is designed in a way that the only pouring speed is dead slow.",Jiri Nemecek,Revisado en Alemania el 26 de mayo de 2022

(edited to reflect customer sevice experience),"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I am updating my review to reflect the good experience I had with the Fellow customer support team. Lisa from Fellow's VIP customer support that is free when you register your product (I advise doing so before anything else, because the serial number is on the bottom of the kettle) got me a new kettle sent out for no extra charge, I didn't have to do anything but confirm my address. A+ job of addressing my complaint. I am leaving the review at 4 stars from a previous 1, because the device is a 4-star product. It's great, and I have used it every day now effectively. It just smells weird when you leave the hold on, and pours slowly enough that it's hard to use for things other than pour-over coffee. If you take these limitations and quirks into account, I believe you get a device that is well-designed and should hopefully serve me for years without incident. It's really good at what it does, which is to heat water precisely while looking good.

Initial review below, titled ""Not durable at all for something so expensive""

I bought this for its precise temperature control. It does that well. I hate how slow it pours, it is very hard to use for anything except for pour over coffee. I bought it for tea over the Cuisinart and the Oxo versions that are substantially cheaper because it goes all the way down to 140F for the lightest of white teas. I really don't like how small it is, I end up having to refill it as soon as I pour a small teapot or two with the gongfu method, although this is not a big gripe.

Another issue is the weird warm-plastic-offgassing smell that this kettle has when the hold mode is used. It is worrying to me and sometimes I wonder if it is releasing some kind of toxin.

Overall, it works well for the purpose it was designed for. But it's a glass cannon! So fragile!

My main problem with this thing is these mystery scuffs that I just noticed on what should be a nigh-pristine device that has never been near anything abrasive. I have no idea what caused them, but I am highly disappointed. The finish on this kettle, which is one of the reasons I paid $65 more for it than comparable models from Cuisinart and Oxo, is not durable in the slightest. You must baby this kettle in order for it not to start looking like garbage. My aunt owns one, and I got it because I liked it, but hers suffers from the same issue, plus the lid to her kettle popped off. I knew this going in, but I had no idea that it would be so easy to scuff that damage could happen imperceptibly.",Voluminous Rancor,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de abril de 2023

Close to perfect,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Build quality is good, it's ergonomic and easy to use, it's durable, and it's very easy to clean.

It only seems to hold around 875ml of water, and some aspects of the design don't appear to serve any purpose whatsover aside from merely looking quite nice, especially around the lid area. I also think the black base needs to be larger so that you can set the lid down on it when you fill the kettle, because otherwise there's no easy way to place it down without either potentially getting the part of the lid that rests inside the dirty, or having it be quite awkward to pick up again to place back on the kettle.

Other than that, it's perfect, and I haven't seen any products that do the job of being a kettle any better than this one. Certainly worth it for the price tag though",Amazon Customer,Revisado en Canadá el 11 de junio de 2020

Overall it's a very nice kettle but it's overpriced and you have no control over the pour rate,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I really like this kettle from a build and aesthetic perspective. The design is nothing short of beautiful and the temperature dial/screen are perfectly simple and satisfying to use.

My issues and why I docked it 2 stars is relative to the expectations of a kettle at this price.

The Good:
1) Fantastic build with a premium feel when holding the kettle and pouring.

2) Controls are exactly what you need them to be. Super simple. Spin the dial to *very quickly* get to the temp you want where the kettle will then hold that temp for quite some time before turning off.

3) Insulated lid helps prevent heat from escaping exactly where it would be trying to escape the most. Great attention to detail that most kettles don't have

4) Genuinely beautiful looking

The Bad:
1) The max fill line isn't accurate in my experience. I fill just below the max fill (I need as much water as possible so I can properly heat up my v60 and rinse my paper filter and have enough leftover for my pour over). However, even when filling it just below the line the water overboils through the top of the lid's vent holes which causes puddling and dripping of scorching hot water. The kettle is only a few days old now and it already has a ton of water marks all over the lid and top area of the kettle

2) The handle gets incredible hot where it meets the kettle. No thermal insulation there. I wish instead of a metal ring between the handle and the kettle body they used a rubberized/silicone spacer that wouldn't get as hot. Because I have burned myself on it a few times because holding it with my thumb on the thumb pad feels awkward and unnatural (for me at least).

3) While this is a fantastic looking kettle with a great build quality in general it's ultimately designed to boil water and pour it consistently. I don't see why this kettle is double the price of other kettles for just that reason.

4) The spout pours VERY slowly. This can be a good thing too but I personally think a kettle at this price range isn't going to be for the casual person or tea drinker. It's going to mostly be for a coffee enthusiast that wants nice coffee equipment with a good aesthetic to boot. The problem with the slow pouring design is you have very little options. Imagine if your car only did the speed limit at most but when you visit another area and the speed limit is higher your car can't keep up with traffic. Depending on the bean/brew style/etc I like to change how I pour while I pour to encourage agitation of the grinds for even saturation/brewing. That's not possible with this kettle because it has two speeds: very slow or dribbling.

5) As an extension of #4 - the slow pouring often creates an air flow issue in the spout making the water go from slow pouring to an inconsistent choppy pour. Think about if you hold a water bottle upside down and it does that blup blup blup pour where air is trying to get in while water is trying to get out making so you (in my experience) have to tip the kettle back then forward again to get the flow corrected. This happens very often and it's very annoying.

So, it's a nice kettle overall - my issues are mostly nitpicky with one or two significant issues (for me) but I think they all matter the same when you're spending this kind of money. If this kettle was closer to $100 I wouldn't be too upset about those issues because the aesthetic and feel are very nice. But like my Fellow Ode grinder, I think it's overpriced for the sake of aesthetic and lacks certain functionality or some overlooked design. It's like buying designer wear intended for the outdoors - you're paying for name+aesthetic more than you are for outdoor performance. In the end I am exchanging this. Wish I wasn't because it's beautiful but I care more about function over form.",Gregger,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de marzo de 2023
Almost perfect. Worth the money if you have it for such things.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","PROS
- Worthy of design museums, IMO.
- Well built
- Simple to use, with some unnecessary nice-to-haves
- Extremely fast heating

CONS
- Possibly the most expensive < 1L kettle on the market not made of semiprecious metal
- Power hog (the price of fast heating); might trip breakers in an old house
- Limited capacity, although not that different from other kettles

Design
Let's get the subjective out of the way: the thing is beautifully designed. It will get compliments from people interested in this sort of thing. The word ""sexy"" will come up. It's a kind of eggshell finish which matches everything on my coffee bar. I like that it's not too glossy. Nice textural compliment to the pieces that surround it. It's also wife-approved, aesthetically speaking, so that's another plus. If they offered a 1.5L version, I'd have bought that. With preheating and bloom, there's basically 1-2 serving limit depending on how much you drink. Another 500mL would be nice, but this is a small complaint. The only reason I bring it up is that you may want to have an alternate brewing apparatus should you wish to provide coffee for more than one or two people.

Material & Build Quality
The handle is great; comfortable texture, ergonomic form, and solid feel. The gooseneck is a great profile and the shaping and finish on the tip exhibits Fellow's attention to detail. It's polished, sharp, and shaped so as to allow very precise pouring. This comes in very handy especially for small pour-overs in the 150-200mL range. The lid appears to be insulated but might just be double walled for structure. Either way, it's a satisfying fit into the kettle itself, and the lid's pull handle feels very solid as well. The base feels solid with weight that is sufficient to assure build quality on par with the kettle. The switches on the back are the only expense that seems to have been spared on first glance. They have a little play to them, but it's perfectly fine for how often you'll actually use them, and nicer switches would just make the unit more expensive. A good compromise in my opinion.

User Experience
I think this is extremely intuitive to use, but I will acknowledge my bias here as an engineer. That said, I think my grandmother could use this without instruction once she stopped making fun of me for having a kettle with a computer screen... I pulled it out of the box, washed the inside, plugged in the base and heated water without looking at the manual. While it was heating, I learned about the timer and hold features. So read the manual to learn about anything you can't figure out on your own. My scale has a timer on it already, so I don't know how often I'll use the one on the kettle, but I taught my tea-drinking wife how to use it and she loves it for steep times. The hold feature is a bit of icing on the cake. With how fast this thing heats water, it's not necessary, but it has been nice in few situations. Some days, I leave the house before my wife. I make my coffee, refill the kettle, set it to 210*F and turn on hold so she has hot water ready when she comes downstairs. I've also used it on weekends when I take my dog for a quick walk rather than just letting him out. Set it to hold at 203*F

Performance & Control
This thing is fast. It's gets water up to target temp way faster than a similar kettle on my gas stove. It's more powerful than my microwave at 1200W. It dims the lights in the dining room (says more about my old house than the kettle). I think the toleranance on the PID is +/- 2 degrees F (or maybe 1 degree C). My only complaint, a nitpick really, is that the full power seems to be used for holding temp controlled by a relay or something similar. With the dimming of the lights, it creates a post-apocalyptic strobe effect. If your house is properly wired, this will not likely be an issue for you lol.

Review after years of use,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","We've been using the fellow stag kettle every day for more than two years now. And by every day, I mean at least 2-3 times a day. Our routine is a pour-over coffee in the morning for my wife, tea for me, and then my wife likes to drink hot water throughout the day.

Overall the kettle has performed well and held up to a lot of use. I see many reviewers complaining about quality issues, and that wasn't a problem for us. Here are some things I like and things I think could be improved on.

Likes:
Form factor - this is probably the best-looking electric how water kettle on the market. We had just finished a kitchen remodel when we got this, and I didn't want an ugly kettle sitting out on the counter.

Simplicity - I don't want a water kettle that I need an app to control. It feels lazy for the manufacturers not to think through all the uses and build the functionality directly into the kettle.

Quality build - For our family, this kettle has held up well even with daily use.

Dislikes:
The lid - There are a couple of problems with the lid design. First off, it fit tight for the first year. Really tight. And since there is no other way to check the water level, you have to remove it regularly to check and make sure you have enough water for your cup of tea or whatever you're making. Secondly, the interior bottom surface of the lid is flat and collects the hot steam from the water. Combine this with the tight fit, and when you pull it off, it flings hot water all over the place. They could mitigate this by sloping the bottom of the lid so the moisture would drip off.

The hold function - I expect the hold function to keep the temperature that I set. But the hold function holds the temperature of the water in the kettle. This means that if you add water to the kettle and set it back on the base, you have to adjust the temperature up or down and then back to its original setting to heat the water to your desired temperature.

The spout - The spout interior diameter should be a little bigger. I expect the spout to help control the flow of water but not restrict it. Even after two years, I still end up tipping the kettle too far and spilling water out of the lid when trying to make tea because I'm not sure if it's going slow due to it being almost empty or just the spout restriction.

Wish it had:
Two temperature presets - I know there is a Bluetooth version with more functionality, but I don't need another app and don't want to pull out my phone just to control the water kettle. I would love to have two simple presets I can manage. Then I can have one for lower temperature needs like tea and hot water for sipping, and one for higher temperatures for pour-over and other coffee options. That would eliminate the need to spin the temperature dial 10 times to shift from one to the other.

Overall I've been pretty happy with the kettle. But, Would I recommend it to a friend? Probably not.",Matt Weitkamp,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de noviembre de 2021
My Favorite Kettle,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I'm actually surprised at how much I like this kettle, given that I almost didn't buy it due to how expensive it is. I mean...it's an electric kettle, right? How is it any better than the $40 one you can get at Walmart?

Honestly, it isn't much better, but I still like it more than the other kettles I've had in the past.

The exterior is matte black, and the inside of the kettle is smooth and reflective. You press the knob, and it turns on and begins to heat up. It takes a couple of minutes to get the full kettle to 205, and it's very quiet. The pour is really precise, and I had no idea how bad my other kettles were until I poured with this one.

There are two specific points that I want to touch on, because a few of the negative reviews put these in my mind:

1. The handle is actually a lot better than I expected. Some people really seem to dislike it, but I find it very comfortable for handling and pouring. I feel like a lot of people are used to a certain shape of handle and then lose their minds when it's different. The nub on the top is really useful for controlling your pour, so you're using your thumb muscles to stabilize the kettle instead of putting the whole weight of the kettle on your wrist. However, the silver ring that connects the handle to the actual kettle gets really hot, so you have to be careful where you put your fingers. I only put my fingers there once, and I've been able to easily avoid it since.

2. I expected the lid to feel like some kind of child's toy after reading some of these reviews, and I can safely say that the lid is one of my favorite parts of the kettle. It slips on and off the kettle easily, but fits securely in place when it's on. A few of my other kettles have the worst lids, some that make you spill water or burn you when you try to lift the lid. The lid on this kettle is really smooth to remove and stays pretty cool to the touch. It's not plasticky or too light like some people mentioned.

The whole kettle has a really nice presentation, and looks awesome on the countertop. It feels a little more manly than having one of those ugly white plastic kettles that sound like a rocketship taking off when you boil water.

I suppose that my only worry would be that the black coating on the kettle may eventually begin to wear or flake off, but I haven't seen any signs of that happening yet.

There are a couple of cons that I've found, but they aren't big.

- The kettle tends to spray water out of the top if you fill it even close to the fill line on the inside. The boil just gets too crazy and water ends up shooting out of the holes in the lid.

- I have trouble getting my kettle past 204, no matter how long I leave it on for. I'm not necessarily upset about this, but it's a bit annoying when you can turn the setting all the way to 210 and it never gets there.",Sneaky Potato,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de mayo de 2018
Attractive kettle but could feel and handle better.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","It's a nice kettle. It warms up the water quickly, holds the desired temperature well enough and having an on-board timer function is nice for anyone who do not own a scale that's also equipped with timer function. The rotary knob is sort of soft-stepped. But I wish the rotation was a bit smoother. If you've used any sort of high quality, smooth rotary encoder, you'll know how nice that feels. This ain't it. But it's nit picking on my part.

It's nice, clean looking and will look inoffensive in most modern kitchens. But the build quality does leave more to be desired. The metal parts are fine. Nothing special but also nothing particularly offensive either. It's the plastic parts that feels a bit cheap. The base itself, the rotary knob on the base, the knob on the top and finally the handle feels like it's made of cheap plastic and in some areas of the plastic, you can feel the moulding lines. But considering this is a 170 dollar kettle, not a 400 dollar kettle, I guess I can't complain too much.

I have not had the chance to hold the other models that has wooden (either in maple or walnut) top knob and handle, but I'd imagine it'd feel a lot better than that cheap plastic feeling. So maybe go for those instead. I would've gone for the matte black + walnut

Fellow makes EKG+ with smart functionality that works with Acaia apps and their scales for 30 more dollars. I honestly don't see the point to be honest. I mean, who wants all that for a cup of coffee in the morning? I'd rather have Fellow make a version of the kettle that has better build and better material.",Jin K.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de enero de 2021
Premium price for a kettle that doesn’t last,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Very nice look and easy function - worked for about 4 years before it ultimately failed (base no longer functions to heat the kettle). Seems like a kettle with such a premium look and price should last longer.

One drawback is it doesn’t quite hold enough water for two people to use without refill unless both are making small-ish cups of coffee - with one tea drinker in the house (using bigger mugs), we often came up short on hot water during the last minutes before hourly zoom meetings would start. Using water to pre-warm cups would make the shortages worse.

At times toward the end of the kettle’s life, there were issues with water leaking from the lid. It’s important to disassemble and clean the lid periodically.

Ultimately going to try the Cuisinart GK-1 for the next matte black kettle, as per Wirecutter’s recommended gear reviews. It holds a bit more water and is much better priced with a similar look.",JuJuBee,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de marzo de 2023
Best flow control from a gooseneck kettle (in my personal experience),"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Uses:
- Coffee Pour Overs (Hario V60)
- Heating water for tea

We purchased this kettle to replace our heavily used and battered Brewista that started leaking where the neck meets the base (we had to put a little pressure on the neck to fill it with our filtered water, so don't fault Brewista for that one).

Pros:

- My favorite thing about this kettle is the control it gives for a coffee pour over. Even very slow pours can be consistent and controlled without the dribbling or rushing that I experienced with previous kettles.

- Looks great, small footprint, not stainless steel

- Comfortable grip with a top thumb position that allows for precision control. Good stuff!

Cons... none really, but here are some observations:

- The excellent pour control seems to come at the cost of being able to pour quickly, so if I'm just filling a large cup with hot water to steep some tea the pour feels pretty slow. If I was going to use this consistently for filling larger vessels, or if I didn't need the pour control I would look for another kettle.

- The Fellow holds less volume than previous kettles I've owned. I didn't like this at first because I was so used to filling my kettle once in the morning for all my pours throughout the day. Now I like it because the water heats faster and I'm not wasting energy by reheating larger volumes of water multiple times.",Manzooka,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de abril de 2022
Great looking. Quick to heat. Small capacity. Slow to pour. No indication that water's ready.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I think the headline says it all.
The electric kettle we replaced, due to it finally died after many years, held over 10 cups and we usually would fill it to the max level and make a large cup of coffee, a cup of tea, and a gallon pitcher of iced tea with a splash on dirty skillets. This is much smaller and have to fill it three times to make the same amount.
The pour is really slow and teaches patience. I don't notice any difference in taste in my tea or her coffee due to it.
There is no chime or indicator to let you know that the water is ready. You have to go over and look at the LED to see if it's at temp.
Other than that, it boils quickly (sea level). Ergonomic design that looks good. I like that we can actually change/lower the temp for green tea, which is why we got it, and that it can keep the temp for a bit in case you have other things going on and don't have to reheat it.
The cons are just new habits to acquire.",DoxieMom,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de junio de 2022
"Overpriced (edit, but works well)","4,0 de 5 estrellas","**(Update at the end)**
After hearing every coffee person on the internet wax poetic about this kettle, I decided to spend the extra money on this one. Turns out it doesn't really perform much better than kettles that are $100 less. It seems to have difficulty maintaining a constant temperature. When you're making a pour over and have to wait after every pour for it to heat back up, it's a problem.
It looks nice, but honestly, the models with the plastic handle don't really feel ""premium"". The knobs and switches all feel loose and wonky. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this unless you MUST have the best ""looking"" kettle.
If it were less money, it would be 3, maybe 4 stars, but since it's the most expensive kettle on Amazon, it gets 2.
**Update: I have sent back the kettle for a replacement. I thought I'd give it another chance. The second unit has arrived and it's working much better! Keeps the temp better, heats up faster! Still, probably too expensive, so it gets 4 stars.",Anthony T,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de julio de 2022
Beautiful & functional,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a beautifully designed & functional electric kettle for US households.

The Stagg EKG has the look & feel of a European appliance. For example, at 0.9 L, it's a smaller footprint than the standard American kettles that are oversized at 1.5+ liters. I prefer this smaller footprint, as this is a similar size to standard European electric kettles. It takes up less counter space, and is sized for one or two cups of coffee/tea.

With a 1200 W heating element, heating is fast - which is also similar to European kettles. The temperature display can also be in F or C - making it convenient for Europeans. Yet, while aesthetically everything seems geared to make this a global product, the Stagg can only run on 110-volts (American) and not 220-volts (Europe).

Overall, I docked a star for three reasons: first, while having the look & feel of a European appliance, it's not actually built to European standards. Second, there's no sound indicator that heating is done. Meaning, you have to watch the LED screen to see when the water has reached its peak temperature. Finally, you have to manually turn the kettle off since the kettle automatically maintains the selected temperature for five minutes. While none of these reasons, on their own, would dock a star, cumulatively, these three quibbles justify some improvements/refinement on Fellow's behalf.

I got the Stagg EKG on Amazon while it was discounted during Black Friday. At $119, it was a great price & easy decision to upgrade from the 1.5L Secura I purchased on Amazon two years ago. The precise temperature control, alone, makes it more functional for coffee pourovers & different types of teas. As importantly, when it's not in use, it's aesthetically beautiful on the kitchen counter.",J.911,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de noviembre de 2018

I roll up a paper towel and use a thick, black rubber band to snap to the lid handle to absorb the vent's output, and I found a washer the right size to affix to the spout (and painted it to match). ^L^ Now I like it even more!",Thomas,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de junio de 2023
Great Pour-Over Pour Rate,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Upgrade from Work Horse Bonavita Kettle:
The Fellow Stagg EKG Pour-Over Kettle a definite upgrade compared to the Bonavita Pour-Over Electro Kettle. Yes, it costs more but its design is superior to the Bonavita. How? The Stagg's fluted spout provides a consistent pour rate, which results in better brewing and extraction of the ground coffee beans. And, a huge plus, it is well-balanced at the handle, which prevents torquing my long-time injured ju-jutsu wrist -- thank you, Fellow Stagg.

Total Cups Per Pour-Over:
The Fellow Stagg kettle holds enough water for one 16 oz. pour-over. Contrast that with the 1.7 liter Bonavita kettle that can provide more than two-16 oz cups of hot water for each pour-over. Both processes include rinsing the paper filter and pre-heating the coffee cup.

Made for Righties (or Living in a Right-handed World):
The Fellow Stagg EKG's digital light for temp and timed-brew is located on the left side of the heating base. This design affects a leftie's ability (me) to concentrate on pouring the water over the coffee grounds and effortlessly keep the timer in view. For example, righties normally place the heating base to their right and timer is closest to them. And, because lefties normally place the heating base to the left of the dripper, the timer is just out of view, thus requiring more effort to keep the water at a constant level during the pour-over. Consequently, I have to use a separate timer (usually my iPhone). While it's not a total deal breaker, it is a design annoyance nevertheless.

Still, though I've had to adjust to another device made for righties, even at a moderately higher price point, the Fellow Stagg's fluted spout and counter-balanced handle offset that by providing an overall superior pour-over experience.

Bummed.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","First and foremost I'm bummed to be returning this kettle. I saved for it because I like the aesthetic, have seen it used in shops I frequent and heard good things. Nevertheless, I am not keeping it due to design flaws that don't meet it's 163.00 (after tax) price tag. In the end, I think FELLOW will appreciate the feedback to take what is a great idea and get it closer to perfect.

The pot itself seems well made and cleverly designed. I love the look and feel. Compared to other kettles I've used, it is sturdier and has fewer crevices for rust to hide. Sure enough, the weighted handle does help improve control of your pour. Before I move on it is worth noting that there was a manufacturing defect where the fill-line was wrongly marked more than once, so there were weird impressions left behind.

Now, my real problems with this product are with the elctric base. Though it's minimalism was a draw for me, it might be overly simple.

With such a beautiful kettle sitting on my countertop, the thick, obnoxious cord has nowhere to hide. Considering the sure size of the somewhat awkward square base, cord storage wasn't accommodated. It seems Fellow knew the base was already too bulky and couldn't find a solution. Even in the images on the box, you can see Fellow is trying to make the best of this design oversight by hiding the cord best they could.

Getting a few buttons out of the way by hiding them on the back of the kettle gives it a sleek, modern look. Instead of buttons, they are toggle switches. However, due to the rest of the products sturdy and durable form, the switches lack of a satisfying *click*, or firmness feels shoddy and out of place.

Due to the fact I'm unlikely ever to toggle the kettle to celsius, I'm more concerned about the HOLD switch. Should I ever need to turn it on after the pot is boiling, I'm reaching my hand around a... um... boiling hot kettle. Because it is a toggle and not a button, once I have it on hold, it will always keep water hot every time I use it unless I remember to turn it off. This feature should be something I turn on only when I want to and not something I need to remember to change.

Goodbye Stagg Kettle. We were nearly compatible. I will be upgrading instead to the much more affordable Bonavita variable temperature model, whose shortcomings are more justified by the cheaper price point. I'm sad.",Juan,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de diciembre de 2018
Style and simplicity,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This electric kettle does what you probably need it to do and very little else: get water up to a temperature and hold it there. This is great for me because I don't need it to do anything else, and the lack of extra buttons/features keeps the unit simple and helps with style (one button/knob combo and a small screen on the front--two small buttons you never need to mess with on the back). I have the black unit and it looks as good in real life as it does in pictures, youtube videos, etc.

There are two small issues with this product that keep me from making it a 5/5:
1. The button to turn it on (which all you need to do to get it to the last temperature set) sometimes doesn't register the press, so I end up having to press it 2-3 times to get it to turn on.
2. The spout's flow rate is noticeably less than other electric kettles (such as the Bonavita) and that may be annoying for some users. I use this primarily for pour-over with a V60 and sometimes an aeropress, and it does not significantly impact those uses.",T. Tonn,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de octubre de 2021
A very nice kettle...,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I went through two other much cheaper kettles before this one. Though this item is very expensive, it does work. In frustration from the other two problem kettles and pictures of rusted ""stainless steel"" with $70 to $100 kettles, I knew I could return this too if it didn't work, so, I hit the buy button. I still think it is too expensive BUT, it does work very well! The pour-over spout allows perfect control, the timer and temperature control are simple and consistant, the stainless is not rusting anywhere! I like how, sitting idle on the counter, its matte black color allows it to blend into the background. Water heats very fast...212 degrees in 2:30 minutes with low noise boiling. The shape and size is perfect for two cups at a time. The secondary pour-over timer helps to make a consistantly delicious cup of coffee. (My only minor complaint regards the metal band of the handle where it meets the kettle. It gets very hot and sometimes my thumb contacts it when I pick up the kettle.)
I find the whole pour-over process a slower, more pleasant and involved way to create a cup of coffee...a peaceful way to begin the day. After years of auto-drip (always coffee wasted and mediocre taste) and a brief foray into auto, single-serve machines. (really not good taste or adequet temperatures possible) this method is a welcome change.
I hope this kettle will provide years of service. I don't think, based on its price, this is too much to expect. If the developers approached manufacturing this product with the same goal, and know they have priced this kettle fairly, I will be enjoying my coffee with it for some time to come.

"Excellent product so far, one annoying caveat","4,0 de 5 estrellas","In general, this is a very beautiful and functional product. The temperature control works very well, and the timer is quite useful. The ""hold"" feature is fantastic, as I like to resteep my teas quite often, and can now do so on a whim.

The only complaint I have with this kettle is its behavior when it's empty. Often, I'll pour the last of the water in order to brew some tea, and immediately place it back on the base. Of course, there's no water in the kettle anymore, so the base will try to heat the kettle. Heating the kettle with no water produces these nasty ""popping"" sounds and damages the kettle. The microcontroller in the base is smart enough to recognize that there's no water in the kettle, but only after a reasonable amount of time, after the kettle has already been heated while dry for a decent amount of time. I understand this is user error to an extent, but it's also a very common and foreseeable use case. If the water detection is currently done using weight measurement (as opposed to checks on the PID loop), this should never occur. The base should not begin heating until it's sure that there's a kettle of sufficient weight in place. If my assumptions about the product are correct, this should not require additional hardware, only a bump to the firmware. An otherwise excellent product (especially at this pricepoint) should absolutely have a failsafe which prevents this sort of behavior from happening. Even if it's the user's fault to some extent, it's an easy feature to implement, and I can't imagine that it's an uncommon occurrence.",Joseph Bergeron,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de abril de 2019
Not the Greatest...,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this Fellow kettle because my Cuisinart GK-1 Kettle stopped working after 6 months of use--not even on a once-daily basis. So, I was disappointed with that brand and then went to this one. So far, what I don't like about this model is that it has no alarm on it that sounds once the target temperature has been reached. Also, the base stays on until you shut it off even if the kettle has been removed and there's no reason for it to stay on. The water also pours much too slowly out of the spout and if you try to pour it at all faster, then it comes out of the top. Also, at least the Cuisinart came with a brush that would fit down the spout. The Cuisinart, although it didn't last long, did have an audible 4 beep alarm when the target temperature was reached and again when the base shut off after the kettle was not on it for about 5 minutes. It also poured faster than the Fellow. Oh well, I'm stuck with this one until it fails, hopefully longer than the 6 months that my Cuisinart lasted.

Looks great but less practical,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","First impression is it's a great looking kettle. Great minimalist design and the base is short so looks good on the counter. The top easily comes off and the opening is big for easy filling. The max fill line is easy to see as well. It heats up fast but once it's about five degrees from the target temperature it really slows down.

The minimalist design has it's draw backs. I switch between temperatures often and their are no preset temperature buttons so I constantly have to scroll the dial to adjust and it's pretty annoying. The two switches in the back are impractical to use so if you switch between holding a temperature and auto shutoff this is probably not the right one for you. The pour on this kettle is not great. It's very slow and the stream breaks up rather quickly. If you make large pour overs I'd probably look elsewhere.",MT,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de julio de 2023
Must Have for Coffee Enthusiasts,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Let's just get down to it.

There is no other variable temp gooseneck kettle that comes close to the sleek design of the Fellow Stagg. I've come to expect quality when it comes from Fellow, and this product is no different.

Looks:
C'mon. Just look at this thing. It's like that niiice matte Mercedes G Wagon you've been eyeing. It's got the lines you drool about. When you look at a kitchen set up and you see this kettle - it's like you need a minute to catch your breath. But in all seriousness, this has the sophisticated look of a modern kitchen. While most kettles you want to hide in the cupboard, this kettle commands attention and deserves its place on the counter. 5/5!

Functionality and Power:
This guy can get to a huge range of temperatures - perfect for the perfect brew of coffee or even the right extraction of tea leaves. But what's more impressive is just how quickly it can reach those temperatures in a way that's barely noticeable - it's so quiet while it's boiling your water up to 212 degrees F - the silence can only be compared to the shock of a Tesla rolling up next to you. You barely noticed it has arrived, but you're sure glad it has. 5/5!

Jealousy:
Yes - my friends are jealous. Yes in my coffee enthusiasts group they exclaim ""This is the best of the best!"" And they are right. 5/5!

In conclusion, I'm happy this has been added to my morning routine. It's impressive in my kitchen - both in looks and power.

"Beautiful, but the water temperature is not correct.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","This kettle is beautiful. Unfortunately, the one that I purchased did not heat water to the correct temperature. In fact, it was off by about 5-7 degrees each time I did a test. I used a candy thermometer and a digital instant read thermometer. Further, I measured the temperature in a ceramic mug and in a plastic measuring beaker. My tests were not laboratory tests but I wanted to rule out user error on my part. In addition to the temperature being too low, I noticed that it didn’t take long out of the kettle for the water to start cooling.

I bought this to replace the variable temperature kettle that I own. Even before testing it recently, I could tell that my kettle wasn’t heating to the right temperature.

Love but developing issues,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this tea pot, it’s very ergonomically designed (feels really good to hold) and I love the temperature dial and ability to maintain the temp for 30 minutes. However, a few years in the tea pot has starting to violently boil occasionally, boiling out of the top, spewing water and hot steam all over the counter, overhead cabinet and electrical base. This happens randomly every few days, and has nothing to do with the water level. Even if it’s an inch below it can happen. It also tends to read a temperature lower than boiling when this happens so it’s basically just losing its marbles every now and then.

I have had this tea pot for 4.5 years, but for the price I expect it to last just as I do any investment appliances like my vitamix.

Best Gooseneck Kettle,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","There's nothing quite like an afternoon cup of homemade pour-over coffee. After doing lots of research (and looking for an upgrade over my existing gooseneck stovetop kettle), I landed on this one. It looks great and it works great. The electric set up is great--it very quickly raises the water to a boil, and keeps it at a specific temperature. There is no question that my pour-overs have improved since I've started using this.

Even putting aside the gooseneck feature, this is an amazing electric kettle for general uses like a pot of tea.

I like Fellow's products, and I wanted to give this 5 stars. The only thing that holds me back is the temperature adjustment knob. The digital screen is great, and the knob feature is handy, but it does seem like the premium, high-quality feel in the rest of the product comes up short with respect to the knob. It has an inconsistent feel when turning it right or left, and is a bit ""clicky"" in a way that does not feel very durable. This is an excellent all around product, and a high-quality one, but if I'm nit-picking, then the knob is the one place it can be improved.",LA.2.NYC,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de octubre de 2020

Last time I wrote my review, it took 8 days to hear back from their support team. I was finally contacted by the founder assuring me they were hiring a full time customer rep to support faster communication/resolution of issues, but it appears that hasn't happened, and that the process has not improved. It's sad that a kettle this expensive is so troubled with issues preventing it from working. It's not even 6 months old, and is no longer functional. I really can't recommend this kettle to anyone given all the quality assurance issues and the abysmal customer support.

**Update 5/23/18** After my initial review, I was eventually contacted by support (it took 8 days to receive a response to my email). They said they would replace the lid and that this was a known issue with some lids. The downside is, they asked for my address for the replacement, and my response went back into the overly long support queue. They notified me 6 days after my reply that they would ship a new lid out. The new lid has been working well so far, and the kettle itself works very well. Therefore, I'm raising my review from 1 to 3 stars - however, their customer support still leaves a lot to be desired. If you're going to sell a premium product that is priced above pretty much all competition, being a small company isn't an excuse to take 2 weeks to resolve a simple matter concerning a product defect.

I really wanted to like this kettle as it heats up quickly, and does a good job at keeping the temperature steady once heated, but the build quality leaves a lot to be desired. On my fourth day of using it, the knob at the very top in the lid fell out of the lid. I can't see how it was really attached to the metal underneath there wasn't any glue remnants, but either way, I can't reattach it without trying to super glue it back down. I contacted Fellow's customer support 4 days ago when it happened, and I never heard back from them. Very disappointing for such an expensive kettle to have such poor build quality and customer service. I'd recommend looking at a cheaper kettle like the Bonavita which I've heard very good things about.",Matt D Graf,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de abril de 2018
"Great design, high price, terrible product support.","1,0 de 5 estrellas","If you had asked me a couple of months ago what my review of this product was after a year of use, I would have rated it favorably. Recently, however, I came down to make coffee as I do each morning and the digital screen on the base of the unit was not operational. At first, I thought perhaps it was unplugged, but after I investigated I realized that everything was normal except now the display simply did not work.

Never fear, I thought to myself - this is a premium product from a company that seems to position itself at the top of the heap. I'll just send them an email and describe the situation and surely they'll correct it. I wrote the email, fired it off, and waited. And waited some more. And waited a bit longer still. After over a week of waiting without a response, I finally get an email at about 6PM informing me that there was simply nothing they could do about my unfortunate situation, but that they would gladly provide me with a 20% off coupon for my next purchase.

I might be wrong, but what exactly am I paying a premium for here? It's not quality, as one of the primary functions of the unit no longer works properly after just over a year. They aren't competing on price, because this unit is priced at the top of a crowded field. And it clearly isn't service or support if all they offer to do is allow me to spend more money with them. I find this to be galling and I will certainly not be spending another red cent on their products after this experience.

I don't care pretty it is, if it costs twice the amount of similarly functioning devices, lasts only a year, and they offer poor service or support... isn't it just a nicely designed way to extract cash from consumers? 1 star out of 5, do not waste your money unless you just want to be making the same purchase again shortly and filling a landfill with anodized junk.",Woodford Clark,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de junio de 2020
Poor design. Kettle will destroy itself during normal operation.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This kettle doesn't protect itself from heating up when it's empty. When I took it out of the box I did what I think is a natural thing to do: plug in the base, turn it on to see if it works, then put the kettle on it (it was empty because I didn't intend to start it). 30 seconds after I heard a clicking noise and realised that the kettle is heating up, I immediately removed it from the base and saw a smoke coming from under the kettle. It looks like it wasn't damaged and all functions are working fine, but I don't understand how I can use it. For example, suppose I finished making my coffee and the kettle is empty, what do I do? I can't put it back on the base, because if I do, then turning it on will destroy it. Do I need to refill it AFTER every use? Do I need to open the kettle after every use to make sure it's not empty? Do I need to unplug the base after every use? There are cheaper alternatives that don't require any of those things.

I think the root cause of this problem is that the kettle has only one button that turns on the display and also starts the heater. It's easier because there are fewer buttons but it's not safe. This is a design problem that I didn't expect to see in a $165 kettle.",Dmitry,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de diciembre de 2022
Experience tea drinker,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I've had this unit for close to a week. A lot of people recommended this kettle. All of them warned me about how slowly the water pours out. After using the kettle the cons far outweigh the pros for me. Cons: no audible alert for when water temperature is attained (the other dozen kettles that I've had all had an audible alert); leaks from the lid; it really does trickle pour!!; Kettle volume; takes over a minute to get from 205 to 212; c/f and keep hot function are manual switches on the back (really? Theres a display and control interface.). Pros: feels like quality; insulated so water keeps warm. I had an Aldi special for about three months. Other than it breaking, the only con was poorly insulated so water cooled quickly. I'd rather have a cheaper made kettle that has more features than a kettle that lasts for 5years and frustrates me. Value just isn't there for me on this one.

EDIT: I decided to return the kettle because the leak at the lid let out more water than the spout! Ammy wouldn't touch it since it was passed the return window and the manufacture responded to my warranty claim that the kettles aren't designed to not leak! Basically refused to do anything.

Base unit stopped working,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","As a premium product priced at 2-3x the competition, I would expect a better product and service. As noted in the video the temperature adjustment knob stopped functioning then two days later the small lcd screen went blank. The unit is about 20 months old. I tried working with Fellow only to find out that if you buy it on Amazon they only support you for 12 months even with proof of purchase while they advertise up to 24 months on their website.

Their proposed solution was for me to buy another base unit at $100 which likely costs under $10. Given there are competitive electric kettles on Amazon for $55-65 their solution doesn't makes sense. Had Fellow responded with a replacement base for less than the cost of competitive full systems, maybe I would be think differently. Fellow does not qualify as a premium brand after my experience so paying $165 for an electric kettle that can't make it 2 years makes no sense.

Just know Fellow is just another cheaply made product so adjust your expectations if you decide to buy from them or better yet save yourself $100 upfront by buying another brand since you can buy 3 competitor kettles for the price of 1 Fellow Stagg EKG.",Danny Piper,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de noviembre de 2022
Unit will not shut off until unplugged,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Really wanted to like this kettle, but...

From the moment I plugged in the base and set the kettle on the base, kettle started heating. It made no difference if the switch indicated on or off. No difference if there was water in the kettle. With water in the kettle, it shot right through any selected temperature and continued to boil until unplugged.

I did not wait until it boiled dry, but there was no indication it would have shut off on its own. So, then what? Shorts out and trips the house circuit breaker? Catches fire? I did not wait to find out.

Given the high review marks on this site and at Wirecutter, I've elected to replace the kettle and give Fellow another shot. We'll see.

FYI... I've learned to inspect merchandise packaging for evidence of receiving a previously returned/used item. The kettle seemed factory packed, however the factory box had a small tear exactly where you would expect if the box was previously opened.",Rick,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de mayo de 2023
Heating element went kaput at 21 months...believe the reviews--it's a LEMON.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I love the style, and while it worked, it was wonderful. It heated water very efficiently, much to my surprise. But buyer beware...the phrase ""style over substance"" applies here. Like other reviewers before me have stated, it WILL DIE. Can't predict when, maybe it's related to how often you use it. I bought mine in July 2018, and it just died last week, in April 2020. So that's just shy of 2 years--and in comparison to other reviews, that's pretty good. I used mine just once a day, but pretty much everyday for that time. The base will still turn on and read the temperature, but it won't heat the water anymore. I bought it knowing the reviews were mixed, so I have no one to blame but myself. I don't like writing bad reviews, but if this review convinces you to save $150, I'm glad. I admit, the kettle design is so striking that I still like the way it looks. If it speaks to you, too, maybe you it's worth looking at their stove top option without the electronic base for half the price (still eye-watering for a kettle). Funny thing, I have a cheapo $20 off-brand electric kettle (regular spout) that I have used multiple times a day for the past 4 years and it's still going like a champ. Not sure why Fellow can't crack the code on this. Electric kettles aren't high tech, so maybe they've just over engineered it...or used substandard components. But at this price??? Come on!",GDA,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de abril de 2020
Wildly overpriced; poorly made; hostile to repairs,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This kettle does exactly what it's supposed to—until it breaks. It's simply not worth anywhere near €150.

I've owned my kettle for 15 months, and it doesn't heat anymore. For €150, it should last the rest of my life.

In addition, the button/dial is very unresponsive. I have to press it multiple times, precisely in the center and very quickly, before the kettle will turn on. For €150, it should intuit that I'm ready for hot water and start heating. I should definitely NOT have to press the one button over & over until it works.

There's also no beep or anything to let you know your water has reached temp. It does have a HOLD button that Fellow claims will keep your water at the specified temp for an hour. I haven't tested, but it's such an obvious, easy thing to add an alert.

Even at its best, it just heats water. You can set it to a specific temperature. That's it. That should be standard. It does an extremely basic thing for an exorbitant price.

If this kettle cost €30, it might be a fair price.",Andrew Customer,Revisado en Alemania el 20 de diciembre de 2022
Dissatisfied with customer service,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I would like to express my dissatisfaction with Fellow Customer Service. I specifically bought a Fellow Electric Kettle so I would not have to deal with quality issues. However the unit we received has an issue with the base switch and does not turn on consistently. It does eventually turn on, but I’m concerned it will completely stop working) This unit is in a second property we own and therefore are only there on occasion.
Because of this issue, I reached out to Fellow customer service and included a video of the units inconsistent function. They have offered to replace the base unit but only after they receive the faulty base from me. The problem with this approach is that it leaves us without the use of an electric kettle while all this shipping is occurring. Since they are located in California and I’m in Indiana I suspect it will be a minimum of two to three weeks. I’ve inquired about the timing however the response I received was “we need to unit shipped back before we will ship”.
I find this policy very unsatisfactory for such a premium product.",Robert Oatess,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de septiembre de 2022
"Yes, it's gorgeous. Buy if you want to look at it. But don't expect quality or service from it.","1,0 de 5 estrellas","Read the negative reviews. Too many of these things simply stop working. If you're lucky they stop working while you can still return them. If not, you're stuck for this pricey kettle. But, hey, it's really pretty so you can use it for a paperweight or something.

Even if it doesn't break down outright, the lid leaks. Again, read the reviews to see how often people complain about leaking lids. Fellows considers it a feature. Their response when I wrote to tell them my lid was leaking: ""The Stagg EKG is tailored for pour-over coffee brewing, so it's designed to have a slow and precise pour. This can cause issues for users since the lid is not sealed and if it's tiled too far, water can leak out ..."" How in the world can someone design a kettle that cannot be poured from without leaking scalding hot water from the lid?

Customer service is worthless. You get a bot-generated reply when you write them.

This would be a great kettle IF it was designed well and built to reasonable quality standards. It looks terrific on your counter. It has a PID temperature controller, which is a great feature. But quality control obviously is terrible because so many, including mine, die an early death leaving you to argue with some bot.

Kettle Nearly Blew Up - Safety Issue - Defective Kettle,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","After about a month of daily use, my kettle suddenly started melting and emitting horribly smelly toxins into the air. For an electronic device meant to handle boiling water, it is terrifying that it could get so close to exploding and melting from heat. I worry about the toxic water I drank from the kettle given it was slowly melting. I am appalled and bought this since it was supposedly the best on the market. I spoke to Amazon support twice and could not even get a replacement kettle. They gave me the seller's information and would not take any accountability in remedying this and replacing the item with a non-defective model. I've never had such a terrible resolution with Amazon so I'm shocked this was the case when an item was so clearly a safety concern. Please do not buy this from Amazon.

Poor design,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Poor design. I ordered this product twice and both times I had to send it back. It doesn’t turn on without a lot of manipulation of the power cord and power button. Also you have to watch the temperature dial in order to take the pot off once the water has reached the desired temperature. This is absolutely useless without a timer. One would think a common sense design would include a timer that beeps when the water has reached the desired temperature. If you have to stand there and watch it it becomes more of a waste of time than anything else. I do not recommend this product. I purchased an electric kettle from Amazon by Cuisinart and I am completely satisfied. The water heats up instantly and it was less than $100. I couldn’t believe I paid nearly $160 for this piece of junk. Don’t waste your money. Like I said I ordered it twice and both times it was malfunctioning.

Generally a usable kettle, but has developed the annoying habit of boiling the top off - regardless of fill level - after it ""detects"" a temperature decrease. The base seems designed to accommodate this, but it does leave water on the counter.

"Unsafe HOT Handle, Slow & Weak Pour, Cheap Switches","1,0 de 5 estrellas","While the EKG kettle looks pretty nice and hearts reasonably fast (probably a bit faster than the Bonavita), the following three things are real problems:

- Part of the handle (metal, near pot) gets really hot, burning your thumb if you try to stabilize the pot while lifting and pouring. (Holding just the plastic handle feels unstable and awkward.)
- Water flow is weak and too slow for our tea and pourovers.
- The two switches on the back (C/F and Hold) feel really, really cheap. How long until they break?! Really...This is what you get for $150?!

"What an overpriced, mediocre kettle","2,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used a collection of different electric kettles from different moves, staying places, and recently replacing our Breville that broke when the glass shattered. This has been one of the most disappointing though

Pros:
- It looks nice
- It's not glass so shouldn't break like our last one
- It gets the water hotter

Cons:
- It's super pricey for the feel of it, lots of plastic
- The one dial button is not responsive, pressing it sometimes produces no result and spinning it to get to the temp you want it annoying.
- The temperature you set it to is not respected. You want boiling 212 water? Prepare to have water shooting out and boiling well past that (yes even when the kettle is below the max line and above the min line)
- Did you empty the kettle and place it back down? Better make sure that you turned it off with the non responsive control button as there's no safeguards to make sure it doesn't try to heat an empty kettle.
- The lid is difficult to use safely after having recently used the kettle, prepare to get burned.

Overall would recommend buyers look elsewhere - thanks for reading the ramblings of one disappointed buyer who wished they'd returned it in the return window.",Todd,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de julio de 2022
Major disappointment,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This kettle, while beautiful, is not worth the premium price. It is extremely susceptible to changes in boiling point of water based on location. I am in a high elevation area, where our boiling point is 202-204. If i set the kettle to 204 or higher, it spits and spews like crazy because it reaches over boil. It is a very normal and standard feature for kettles to have automatic stops for overboil. My old bonavita gooseneck just never reached a higher temperature if I set it over boil because it clearly had a stop, and that was almost half the price of this kettle. This really does seem like a safety hazard having used it for a few months now, and I am extremely disappointed. As soon as it shows its first signs of malfunction, I am going to go back to something that won't boil over. I am really disappointed because it is a really beautiful kettle, and I keep my kettle out at all times, so it was great to feel like it was adding to the decor of my kitchen in addition to having function.

So when you lift the lid, the stainless steel portion stays sitting in the pot. No epoxy, resin, glue etc. will hold it back together as water seems to sit between the layers and hang out.

Stopped working properly after only two days!,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I just moved into a new apartment and splurged on the Stagg EKG as a housewarming gift to myself. I prefer a gooseneck spout as I primarily use electric kettles for coffee (pour over method) but I did like the ability to set variable temperatures for the occasional cup of green tea.

It looks gorgeous and appears to be well constructed. It worked as advertised for the first two mornings. After the second morning, it took several attempts for it to start. I even tried different outlets in my kitchen. It would eventually turn on after several attempts (usually just as I'd given up and set a pot of water on the oven top to boil). I've had quite a few cheap electric kettles ($20-$30) that I've previously bought for home and the office and I've never had any problems with them starting up until they were at least a few years old.

This is my first electric kettle. Controlling the water temperature and the narrow spout make great, consistent pour-over coffee. My only negative observation is the on/off button. It does not always respond and there are times I've had to unplug the unit then plug it back in to get it to turn on. At first I thought I was pushing the button either to fast or too long but this is a consistent problem and makes me worry about the longevity of the electronics.

The main issue is it stopped working. My backup electric kettle is 8 years old, cost $30, and still works fine. The Stagg cost more than 4 times as much and no longer functions.

Maybe I will try to get it fixed with Stagg, but don’t really feel like the hassle.

Other less major gripes. The water pour flow is too slow. My Hario pour much better. It is cluckly, takes up more space than I’d like. My Bona Vida at work is smaller, has a less bulky cord.

The thermometer readout is jumpy. Needs a Kalman Filter or something to smooth out the readout.

The wattage is mediocre and heat times are slower than my old kettle.

Right now we’re just keeping a hawk eye on it and turn it off before it boils, but that really frustrating for what’s supposed to be a nice morning routine.

Great - But,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","If you are considering this product, you are more than likely a coffee or tea connoisseur - as am I. Overall the product is fantastic; fast, controls temperature, and even has a switch to maintain temperature. However, scaling is a bigger issue. I have provided two pictures. Both pictures are after a single 400g water heating and after a complete descale. The water used is from a Kitchenaide refrigerator with a new (1 month old) water filter. The compared kettle is a Gator Coffee Stainless Steel ""Stove Top"" kettle. NOTE - I have not tested with Distilled water as of yet. However the pictures tell the story. The heating element is not uniform thus creating a ""hot spot"" where build up occurs more rapidly. This is either a result of bad construction, inferior stainless steel, or both. Having purchased the unit in August of 2022, I have had to descale after 3 to 5 days of use.

Filling it is a pain,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this kettle about 6 months ago, and there are many things it does well - its easy to slow pour for brewing pour-over coffee, it has excellent temperature control, and it's great at holding a set temperature. What is terribly difficult is filling it. I need to fill it to max each time because of the size of my coffee maker and the max fill line is inside on the side of the pot in only one small area - making it nearly impossible to see in anything other than a very well lit room. If you accidentally overfill it - even a little bit - it will boil over and shoot hot water out.

"Beautiful, but lacks functionality for price","3,0 de 5 estrellas","This kettle is extremely aesthetically pleasing and satisfying to pour- but for this extremely high price point, I was expecting much more. The lid leaks slightly if you don't have it in at the perfect (unmarked) angle. Also the kettle does not notify you when it hits the set temperature. You just have to check it when the loud boiling sound stops to see if it's actually at the temp yet- although it quiets down before it reaches your temp so... Also the temp control dial feels plastic-y and the screen is limited in what it shows. Again- you don't need much, but for this high price I was expecting more.

Overall, it gets the job done but for $165 I was expecting it to be incredible. I'm 50/50 on whether I will keep it or not. Not sure why someone else doesn't make a similarly aesthetically pleasing one for half the price.",John DeCesare,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de diciembre de 2022

After three weeks of using this, I got really tired of burning myself literally every time I made a pour over. The lid does not seal and drips boiling water constantly. I am positive this is a universal issue as my sister has one and I’ve used several in coffee shops. Additionally, out of the box, the on button worked about 50% of the time, and I had to finagle the connection to the base in order for it to start heating.

"Pretty from far away, functional","3,0 de 5 estrellas","I am judging this product based on its cost/value relative to comparable competitors that accomplish the same for 50%-30% the price

Dislikes:
The temperature switch and the hold switch are wobbly and feel cheap
The powder matter finish coat on the outside of the kettle seem to go up into the lip of the kettle, perhaps over spray during the coat/spray process.
The gooseneck spout has some rough sharp edges that appear uneven
The gooseneck spout shaping process left the tip of my aluminum spout with a recessed bit that look darker and unpolished.

Likes:
LED screen that shows temperature setting and current temp
Knob for gradual controlled temp control
Click knob for power on/off
click and hold knob for start timer
Spout pour rate is controllable
kettle heating pad has non slip silicone ring
looks gorgeous from far away

Stopped Heating water,"3,0 de 5 estrellas",I have had this kettle for a year and 8 mos. It stopped heating water :(. I reached out to the company for assistance and they guided me though descaling with citric acid (their assumption was there was hard water build up on the temperature gage preventing the kettle gage from detecting water temperature to heat water.) Unfortunately the descaling process didn't help the matter and since I'm beyond the 1 year warranty the only option was to spend another $150 to get a new gooseneck kettle. No thanks! :( I'd rather buy a new kettle at a fraction of the price and not feel so bad if the cheap-y one peters out after a year or two. Major bummer.

Areas for Improvement:
1. Pour - I'm not sure what exactly causes it but the pour gets very choppy which results in burns caused by splashing boiling hot water. I don't necessarily think this is related to pouring ""too quickly"" as I've tried different angles/speeds/ways of pouring and can't tell what's causing the choppiness.

2. Indicator - I also wish there was some sort of subtle noise indicator when it's reached temperature--I walk away and forget about it. Too subtle for everyday use. It's times like that when I actually realize and miss the purpose of a click or beep or whistle from other kettles I've used.

I like the stopwatch feature and the switch between F & C. Beautiful, but at this price point it needs to focus on the very basics of a kettle: reliability and practicality.",Daphne Wu,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de enero de 2019

The design could have insultation around the ring. I wrapped a rubberband around. Also, the lid has steam vents to be careful of...stay away from the vents.

Prettiest kettle on the market.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Overall this kettle is great. It's quick, it's simple, it's attractive when, in my opinion, essentially no electric kettle is. It has the most important feature for an electric kettle in my opinion: variable teperature control to the degree. It goes as low as 104° which I do occasionally have use of. It's really well thought out and executed for the most part which is why I'm going to pick on it a little harder for where I think it falls short.

My one problem with it is with the handle, knob, and top part of the lid. The plastic that they are made of isn't super pleasant. It's not bad but with the care put into the rest of this great appliance, it seems lackluster. It also makes it so that where the handle is flat, the corners don't feel nice. With a kettle $50 less and not made with the same care, I wouldn't even notice. But when its packaged inside the box with special twist ties that are buttery smooth, it seems like these things shouldn't have been overlooked.

The bottom line though is that I would (and have) recommend it to a friend. There are others that do the job just as well at a lower price point but it's nice using and being around well made things. Besides that, the built in timer is super handy. Who has a timer at the ready ever? I do now.",John,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de marzo de 2018
"It works, and the temperature control is phenomenal. There are some drawbacks.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Temperature control is great. Having something that I know keeps it hot when making tea or coffee is great.

Maximum pour rate is really low though, and it’s really slow for anything other than a pour over.

Also the spout doesn’t lend itself to splashless pouring.

Long term edit:

1. Kettle wasn't turning off after water boils away (which is relevant because you'll put the kettle back onto the base after finishing your pour, and it'll resume).
2. Contacted support
3. Support has replaced my item.

Keeping it at a 4 because while the defect was quite bad (and honestly dangerous), support was very helpful replacing it. Haven't had the issue since, but I've also made sure to hit the button every time I put the kettle back. This defect was very scary for me not because I can't work around it, but because my family using the kettle wasn't aware of the issue.",Allen Su,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de agosto de 2021

Beautiful Piece; Slow Pour,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Specs: Matte Black

Pros:
-Beautiful piece on the countertop.
-Good temperature control; rarely overshoots.

Cons:
-The smoothness of the pour is average as demonstrated on youtube. There are smoother pouring kettles in the same price range.
-The restrictor means the pour is very slow. If this kettle is only used for pour-overs, this is not an issue. For anything else, it pours too slowly. You would have to remove the cap and pour from the top which is not optimal.

Conclusion:
-If this is being used only for pour-overs, and you like the way it looks, this is a solid kettle.
-Otherwise, a Bonavita variable temp kettle may be a better bang for your buck.",Gary Tsai,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de enero de 2022
I recommend this item!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","“I received this as a birthday gift (thanks, Mom!) and it replaced a simple Bodum kettle without a gooseneck, so it was a huge step from what I had used for years. The fit and finish of the kettle is good with a really nice matte black texture. The handle is ergonomically very nice, but I do wish there was a more effective thermal break. The base of the handle still gets very hot, so I have to be careful how I hold it. Getting it set up and heating water was quick with no problems. The option to hold the temperature for an hour or turn of automatically after 5 minutes is great flexibility. The temperature control knob has nice detents with satisfying little clicks for each degree of adjustment. The screen’s placement is great, but the display quality could be better, but it’s still very convenient and easy to read. The pouring action of the kettle is amazing, as expected. So overall, this setup has not only made my coffee taste better, but it has improved my enjoyment of making pour-overs in my kitchen.

Dead after 9 months...,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Update:

Customer service performed well and replaced what was determined to be a faulty base quickly and easily. I am updating my rating to four stars accordingly - but not five stars because I am still uncomfortable with the fact that a $150 kettle stopped working in under a year. If it stops working in another 9 months, it will be outside of the year warranty and I will be irate that I spent this much money on an electric kettle.

Is it beautiful? Yes.

Easy to use? Completely.

Is it dead after 9 months? Very.

This is the first electric kettle I've owned. I have watched roommates mourn strings of dead and dying electric kettles in the past, and never wanted to deal with the heartbreak myself - I am a person who values longevity in their purchases.

"Quality Kettle, Be Careful of Spilling On Your First Pour","4,0 de 5 estrellas","This kettle is great, heats up quickly.

Happy gaiwan style tea drinker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I'm a tea drinker who is getting into gaiwan style brewing. I switched to this kettle from a stovetop kettle and am very pleased. The two things I like the most are the temperature control and the temperature hold feature. The kettle feels very solid, and the handle is surprisingly nice in my hand. The pour is really good, but is much slower than my ancient stovetop kettle, and I haven't got used to that after a week. I accidentally tip it too far over, trying to get water out faster. The base doesn't move around at all on my kitchen counter and it's easy to lift the kettle off and replace it without fumbling. Setting the temperature is dead simple and the entire thing is well thought out. It's a lot of money to heat water, but I'm happy I spent it. My inexpensive teas are so much better at the correct temperature - I thought for sure that was a tea snob thing. But the difference is striking. So much so that I'm now encouraged to buy some expensive tea now that I can brew it at the correct temperature.",Michael Calabro,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de marzo de 2018
Pour precision and great user interface. Much better than the Bonavita,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Wow! It’s pricey but well worth it. I have the Bonavita temperature controlled version and the only thing better about the Bonavita is the price.

The pour control from the kettle is exceptional and the hold temperature switch is great. Everything about this kettle just works. It’s very simple to set the temperature and you can have it hold the temperature with a simple flick of the switch on the back.

This small switch on the back makes all the difference in the world. The Bonavita doesn’t have this switch. It has a button that you can press but the thing is you must press this button every time. Meaning that for the Bonavita, if you take the kettle off of the base to pour and then put it back on you must press the hold temperature button again...every time! It’s a small thing but it makes a difference and has always annoyed me. The EKG however, you just flip the switch and forget about it. No matter how many times you take the kettle off of the base.

The real place where the EKG outshines the Bonavita is the pour. The Bonvita pour control and precision are a joke. The EKG has it figured out. It’s even better than a standard hario kettle (non electric).

I was reluctant to splash out the cash for this but honestly I’m only disappointed that I wasted money on my Bonavita and didn’t pickany up the EKG sooner.",Matt,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de agosto de 2018
"Fantastically designed product, worth the price","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I hesitated to enter at this price point, but went for it and do not regret it. Everything about this product was designed thoughtfully and successfully. I can for the simplicity of controls, which does not disappoint. The spout connects in a sunken lip at the base, which means steam does not pour out of it when boiling. Pouring is smooth and easy, as I imagine with most goosenecks. Easy to open, fill, and clean. Handle feels great. Intuitive controls to set temp. Unobstrusive but no less intuitive controls to toggle temp hold and to start a timer.

If I had to list cons:
- Capacity is smaller than many common electric kettles, but it will still easily make 3+ pourovers.
- The spout pours at the speed it wants to. If you tip more, it will only start coming out of the steam holes at the top. If you need to pour more rapidly for some use, open the top and pour out on the side.
- Changing set temp is by 1 degree. Which is great if you want that precision, but it actually takes several seconds to switch from 200F to 120F, which are my two most used temperatures. Not a problem, just used to doing so in a couple clicks with my old kettle.
- I wish I didn't have to wait for the Fellow logo (just 1 sec) when turning it on to set the temp. Maybe I should slow down...",Andrew Schwartz,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de septiembre de 2018
Absolutely up to the hype.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","After reading tons of reviews, watching James Hoffman's kettle shoot-out, and months of asking myself if a kettle could possibly be worth the asking price of the Stagg EKG, I finally pulled the trigger in an impulse moment. I have ZERO regrets. This is a serious, high-quality piece of well-engineered and carefully manufacturer kit. I purchased it primarily for using with a Hario V60 and Aeropress. But it works so beautifully and is so enjoyable to use that it's being used constantly for not just coffee but also hot tea. You really have to pick it up to realize just how well it's made. Nothing flimsy about it. And the electronic controls are absolutely adequate without being too much. And the user interface is pure art. If you're on the fence, just do it.",Jon A Delamarter,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de diciembre de 2022
EXCELLENT Customer Support,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My first kettle came, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It looks incredibly nice on my countertop, and the temperature worked exactly as I needed it to (no more burnt green tea leaves!). However, over a bit of time, I noticed that the water sensor started to break, sometimes saying that there was water in the kettle when there wasn't, and vice versa. This wasn't too concerning, but then the temperature started to fail as well, marking room temperature water as nearly boiling. I got in contact with fellow, and they agreed to send me a replacement.

Now for the great part, due to COVID-19, there were some delays and issues, and my replacement ended up getting lost in the shipment processing. Two weeks of headache dealing with UPS claims, and finally I decide to reach out to fellow to see if there is anything they can do. They were kind enough to send ANOTHER replacement even though it was no fault of their own for my first being lost in shipment. I cannot commend enough how happy I am that they were quick to respond and willing to do so for me. That customer service alone deserves 5 stars, and I know the kettle is amazing as well due to how great of an experience I had with it prior.

Thank you fellow for providing such a great service, I know if I ever have any coffee needs that this will be the first place to look!",Erik7brown,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de abril de 2020
Very elegant,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","It got here today and I have not even plugged it in yet. It is the most pleasing design and I cannot keep my hands off its curvy body. My American friends think I am terribly hip to be preparing my coffee that way but I have been doing that for 60 years. In Germany in 1950 when good coffee beans were available again I would put the kettle on the wood fired cooker, grind the beans until the glass jar under the grinder mounted on the kitchen dresser was full, pour some hot water on the paper in the Melitta filter to get it wet and warm up the china coffee pot, put the fragrant coffee grounds in the filter, dump the warming water out of the pot and slowly pour the nearly boiling water in a thin stream in the middle of the coffee grounds to let it find its way to the walls of the filter and down in to the warm pot. My mother would find us some of her home baked treasures and we would enjoy the afternoon in the garden.
When I came to the United States my husband surprised me with an electric percolator, yuck, then a constant stream of coffee machines but I stuck with my pour over method.Life got really good when Amazon started carrying Lavazza coffee and I started using my Alfi thermos, my new kettle just completes the picture.

Great electric kettle for pour over coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this teapot. It's a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.

Super durable. Great for tea, French press and pour over coffee! Love it!",Dennis,Revisado en Canadá el 29 de mayo de 2023
Game Changer,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","So I have had several water kettles but none have been to the degree and hold that degree accurate. I haven't tried any of the other gooseneck kettles. With that said this kettle is a game changer for me. I can have a long gongfu session and know without checking that my temp is where I want it each and every time. Even as the water is going down in the kettle. It adjusts and holds it at your set temp. It takes away water temp and pour as variables that I need to upgrade my equipment for.
So it would be nice if there were buttons for default temps or for setting your on temp. Not having them keeps the design simple but having them could be convenient. The pour control is amazing and such a pleasure to use. The only real thing I will change on the unit is adding a marking inside the kettle where the water fill line is on the opposite side of the kettle. Its only on the side with the handle and doesn't show for me without having to turn the kettle spout towards me. I really enjoy the kettle and would buy again in a second. Not sure how it compairs to others but it is hard to imagine they could beat it in temp stability or pour control.",Bill Windle,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de septiembre de 2018
Birthday gift,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I just gave this to my younger son for a birthday gift. It is too soon to get his review. However, I only purchased it because I gave my older son one for a house warming gift. His review was that it works great and he uses it for everything not just pour over coffee. I consulted him because of the mixed reviews on Amazon. I did immediately register the kettle for its warranty, because one review mentioned getting good service because of the warranty.

Designed + Engineered Beautifully,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have used my kettle 2-3 times per day every day for 2 months since my purchase. Not a single issue.

Its aesthetics are brilliant and instructions are clear. Crystal. It is an enjoyable addition to mindful hot beverage making. It is not inexpensive at all. I have recouped some of its cost daily by not buying hot, brown water that costs between $2 - 6 per cup.

It is never going to be a kettle sold in discount stores. You won't turn into a 'snob' just because of its cost. That might be an issue for a different review elsewhere. Enjoy your beverages whichever kettle you choose.",GKripner,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de mayo de 2023
Use it multiple times a day,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I was hesitant to get the kettle since it’s not cheap but I’m so glad I did. I use it every morning for my tea and it has become part of my morning ritual. It feels way nicer than my $25 kettle and I naturally just use it a lot more. I don’t get burned as much touching the kettle on accident, it heats up so quickly and quietly. I love how I can set the temperature I want.

Love this kettle,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I love the look of this kettle, that's what drew me to it. I know there are a lot of cheaper knock offs, I've already returned one. This one is balanced, seems to be well made and has dead simple controls for temperature. The only caveat here is that this is designed purely for pour over coffee, maybe tea. The flow is intentionally restricted for this purpose so if you are trying to pour large doses of water quickly this isn't for you. If you don't need any features and want a quicker pour I highly recommend the Amazon commercial kettle. It's cheaper and reliable. Love my Stagg though.",Jack Sparrow,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de febrero de 2023
The Easy Choice is to Make the Best Choice,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I’ve been a tea drinker for decades, but only recently began to explore the world of great coffee. I was soon attracted to making pour-overs (arguably the single best way to make a great cup of coffee). This kettle is absolutely perfect for this. The features include the ability to set the temperature to the exact degree you desire and a creatively-designed spout that allows you to direct the coffee with precision (and at a perfect flow rate).

If you know what you need, the easiest choice is to select the best product in its category. This kettle is precisely that.

I am happy to report that the company’s exceptional customer service matches the quality of this product. After two years of daily use (and several times a day), I experienced a problem. I submitted a request for help on their website one night, received a response the next morning, and a brand new kettle was delivered the very next day...free of charge and free shipping!

They set the gold standard other companies should follow: well-designed, expertly constructed products backed up by superb customer service. Well done, Fellow!!",Steven Kleinman,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de marzo de 2020
Fantastic,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a great product. Easy to use, well designed, well built, aesthetically delicious.

I moved from a Bonavita Gooseneck stovetop kettle to this. The two major changes from the Bonavita are the ability to maintain a consistent temperature and the flow regulator on the inside of the kettle.

The consistent temperature is great if like me you value being able to control as much of your brew process as possible.

The flow regulator (a simple metal plate with holes; inside the kettle where the spout connects) is a dramatic improvement over the Bonavita. This allows for a highly consistent flow rate as your pour which is important, again, for controlling variables. In this case the variable is agitation of the grinds.

If you are looking to step up your game from a simple kettle, and want an aesthetic nirvana that is above and beyond the norm, this is the kettle for you.

Note: I chose this kettle over the one that connects to my phone because I could not come up with a reason why connecting this to my phone (or to the Acaia Pearl scale brew app) would be worth the extra $50. This electric kettle as-is is most sufficient.",Prattlesnake,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de agosto de 2018
Form Follows Function,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Best looking pour over kettle on the market IMHO. The form is balanced well for pouring, does not drip when pouring and is completely stainless steel inside except for a small 3/16” food grade silicon gasket for the stainless temperature probe. The EKG base is elegant in simplicity and minimal in size so it doesn’t add clutter to my countertop. ‘Less is More’ really works in this heating base and kettle unit. The base heats quickly with the digital temperature display easy to read at a quick glance. Tested the auto shut off with low water and is performing as it should.

This is my second EKG kettle as the first kettle’s base quit working in four days. Boy, was I disappointed and promptly went to the Fellow website. Nicely designed website, great graphics etc. but as a customer I wanted some help to reset that digital base. Alas, no telephone to call or even a useful problem solving forum so I could figure whether a reset was possible or the unit needed to be returned. I left an email expressing my disappointment and Fellows did contact me a couple of days later. Fellow’s customer specialist, Nick, convince me to give the EKG another try. I am glad I did as I really love this little kettle.",Theodore Rex,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de julio de 2018
Fantastic for pour over coffee and everything else,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This tea kettle is so great! Fantastic for making pour over coffee, but also just a pleasure to use for any need you have for heated water. Tea, oatmeal, whatever. And it heats water quickly. Highly recommended. Be sure not to run it when empty or near empty. There is a minimum water level and below that you could damage the kettle.

EDIT: bought this in June 2020 and loved it until today. It seems to have died. It now says No Water when there is water in the kettle. Trying to figure out how to get a warranty repair. For now I’ll set it to 4 stars, because maybe I just got a defective one.

EDIT2: I'm leaving the above because it certainly happened, but actually the kettle seems to have recovered. In talking with Fellow, it can happen if the base or kettle is submerged in water. Well, we didn't do that, but it's possible some water got where it shouldn't have been. In any case the next day it was back to normal and working great again, presumably because whatever water was causing the problem dried up.",Stephen J,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de julio de 2020

The Perfect Kettle,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have nothing bad to say about this product! I’m more than happy with it. I’ve wanted it for a long time and I finally took the plunge and it was well worth it. The temp control is amazing, the options to hold the heat or not, the time, the sleek design, it’s flawless.

I moved from a level kettle, which I thought for a long time was the best gooseneck out there. Nothing else gave me the kind of control I needed, and my biggest gripe about level was their inconsistency in quality control and the fact that there was no electric version, so I would hear water in a separate kettle and change containers. So mildly inconvenient! But the Stagg delivers in all those areas in spades.

My only complaint, which is small, is the small metal band between the handle and the kettle. That can heat up fairly easy and if you’re not careful and can burn your finger a bit. Besides that, it’s absolutely flawless!

Oh also I find the tech on the plus mode a touch unnecessary, only because I own an acaia pearl. If I didn’t though, I’d get the plus.",Richard Barker,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de noviembre de 2018
Love it!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Love this kettle! I can fill it, set the temp, and walk away. By the time I am done grinding my coffee and prepping my French press, it is at temp, and ready to pour. The narrow pour spout really allows you to control the pour, and I think it will be an especially nice feature when I eventually try a pour over system!

The nice sleek design makes this kettle easy and quick to hand wash as well!

For those that have said it overflows, I can only assume that it is being filled past the ""Max Fill"" line. I have filled it to the line multiple times, and have not had an issue. The only thing I will say is that it may leak from the lid if you tip too far when it is full.

Flawless Performance Since March 2018,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We've used this unit two to three times per day for the last 16 months to heat water for pour over coffee.

The water temperature of coffee needs to be controlled to within a few degrees F of accuracy, which is why we looked past the popular units that only have 15-degree steps. Different beans need different temps, and fresh coffee needs to be a little a bit hotter with a faster extraction to avoid excess acidity from CO2 absorption. We can taste the difference between coffee brewed at 190F and 180F coffee *easily* in blind taste tests.

Anyway, I am coming back here to buy another one, but not for us - as a gift. Because our still works perfectly. I noticed that there are many reviews about reliability issues, and while I believe them all, there is a bias in reviews where reviewers are more likely to leave one if something's wrong with the unit. So I just want to add this little anecdata: ours looks great and works the same as the day we bought it (March 28 2018, according to Amazon).",Oorah,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de septiembre de 2019

Well-balanced electric kettle to make great drip coffee!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been using this electric kettle for a few months to make drip coffee.

I like the sleek design of the kettle and also modern-style charging base! Very convenient to boil water with the dial on the base and 'hold' option is also useful to maintain temperature. I tried a few other electric kettles at a local store, but design of the Fellow kettle was the most attractive and it's relatively less heavier than the other models to pour water into my drip coffeemaker and tea maker.

We had a minor issue around the lid as it's a bit rough to pull out, but now it's been working fine. When we had a chat with the customer representative, they're very helpful and willing to address our issue.

Coffee engineering at its finest.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have had the Stag kettle for about a year. During that time it operated every day and did exactly what I asked of it. Very recently the kettle actually stopped heating. The device would still turn on and display temps but would not heat. I contacted Fellow right away and everything went extremely smooth. Nick from Fellow got everything taken care of and shipped a new unit out to me. Fellow asked if I would be willing to ship my unit to them, using their prepaid shipping label, because it sounded like a manufacturing flaw they wanted to know about. Long story short I just got my new unit today and everything is back to working order.

customer service solved my problem,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","After a few months my Fellow Stagg EKG kettle's temperature control appeared not to be working and would not ""hold"" my set temp. Some of the reviews I read cast a poor shadow over customer service and I was braced for the worst response. But, that was not to be the case. The gentleman who helped me troubleshoot the problem was very accommodating. He directed me to a small control switch on the back of the kettle base which had the ""hold"" control. If that did not solve the problem, the unit would be replaced, at their cost. Thankfully, the problem was solved with a flip of the switch! But I was also assured Fellow would back up their product within the 1 year warranty period. I would recommend the Fellow Stagg EKG with temperature control.

Beautiful pot and hot water in minutes!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this! I've never had an electric water kettle but saw this somewhere and I'm loving it! It heats up the water in under 2 minutes, is stylish and very simple to use. The only complaint I have is the instructions booklet is printed for people with super vision! It's in about 6pt. type and even with my reading glasses on it's difficult to read. The other this is that it came with an insert that talked about the icon on the inside of the pot that indicates a fill line. It doesn't say MAX on it as the paper indicated and the icon (which was supposed to look like mountains) is a straight line with no writing. Not that big of a deal, but it was confusing. I figured out how to use it without reading the instruction booklet, but it looks like there are some tips that might be useful. This booklet should be printed with larger type.

THEN, lo and behold, my original two kettles started working again! I offered to send back the complimentary one that Fellow had sent, and they told me I could just keep it for my honesty. Who does that???

I absolutely love it! I recently returned from a long time working at the South Pole and McMurdo Station Antarctica where we all had to have the same (nasty) coffee every morning made the same way for all to share. I learned there of the method of pour over coffee where I learned to make my own strength. When I returned home, I tried various coffee makers but none could give me the benefits of great coffee with each cup like pour over method. So I researched options until I found this one. IT'S PERFECT. I'm planning to buy two more as gifts for friends who share my love for great coffee.",JMP,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de marzo de 2021
"I expected high control, but also got super fast heating!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","This kettle was definitely a luxury purchase. For Aeropress, Cemex, and French Press coffee and the perfect cup of tea, I wanted to do it right. My previous kettle that brings the water to a boil and then shuts off was fine, but this is a whole new world. The one knob interface allows me to easily change between the temps that I need (and if you pay any attention to YouTube, 1 degree can make or break the perfect cup of coffee! :) ) It also heats up so much more quickly than my other kettles. There is nothing about this kettle that I would call a detractor.

It is sexy and can be left on the counter as a decoration piece, but also easy to move around and store away. Worth the price? Yes indeed!",Chris C,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de noviembre de 2019
Phenomenal Product!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The Fellow Stagg kettle is a great accessory for any pour-over or aeropress user. The kettle heats up water quicker than many of the other electric kettles I've used and puts stove top kettles to shame. The hold mode allows me to throw the kettle on at any point during my morning routine and know that I'll have perfectly heated water to pour whenever I'm ready to brew my coffee - a super nice convenience. The handle and spout design make it incredibly easy to control when pouring and the overall design is very chic and clean looking. I have it in matte black as it goes with the rest of my kitchen appliances better but having seen the copper and silver versions, I can confirm that those look very nice as well. All-in-all, I cannot recommend this kettle highly enough!",bsims,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de septiembre de 2019
Best coffee kettle on the market,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've had my Stagg EKG for about 6mo now and it is absolutely one of my favorite purchases of the year. The kettle looks fantastic, who knew a kettle could be a work of art but it is. I've had a few pour over kettles in the past but this one has by far the most precise pour function I've used. Heats up within 3min for a full .9L kettle and maintains a precise temp. Past kettles I had to boil it and then use a analog thermometer or just wait for it to cool a bit before using but you always know the temp on the stagg.
I had a problem develop with the hold function after 5mo of use and the kettle would turn off once it reached set temp, however Fellow honored the 1yr warranty behind it and replaced it perfectly. Highly recommend this for coffee/tea lovers out there",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de agosto de 2018
Very stylish and functional,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The only disadvantage of this kettle comparing to other products is that its volume is only 900 ml. For me it's fine though.
It doesn't beep when it turns on and off as well as when you set the temperature, etc. It's also pretty silent when working.
Be aware that it's getting hot itself, so you can take it with its handle only.
Materials are great, I would only change the glass of the screen and make the dimmer made of more solid plastic or metal.
I'm probably going to buy accessories for making coffee with this kettle in the future.",Ilya Kremer,Revisado en Alemania el 18 de mayo de 2022
Makes a huge difference,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been using the Fellow Stagg EKG, Electric Pour-over kettle every day for about a month now. Previously I was doing pour overs using a 1950s style electric tea kettle. The difference is night and day in the way the coffee tastes. The EKG will keep the water at a constant 200F until the entire pour over is finished. I've discovered that constant temperature really does make a difference. The controlled volume of water that comes out of the spout makes it easy to do perfect spiral pour overs. The kettle seems solid and well built. I saw one review where a ""professional"" barista could not figure out how to hold the kettle comfortably. I have no idea what they were doing - this thing is balanced perfectly no matter if it's full or empty.",Chris Walken,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de enero de 2021
I really like this kettle,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this kettle in October and I absolutely love it. It is very nice looking and works great! Then almost 3 months into its use, it stops working. I went onto Amazon's listing and read that if you have problems you have to go to Fellow's website. I was very unhappy to learn on Fellow's website that they will not warranty the kettle if purchased from Amazon. Refusing to let this go I called Amazon, stated my case and they sent me a new kettle and I sent them back the original one. I am hoping this is not a flaw in the machine and that I just got a lemon the first go round. I am still giving the product a 5 star because it deserves it....when it is working. FYI, save the original boxes just in case.",Barbara Lemke,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de enero de 2019
THE BEST,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Expensive but simply the best out there. Great precision and function. Difficult to clean internally and the black exterior not easy to maintain that ""new look"". Would like to have a brighter temp. digital display. Nevertheless a great product.",garywren,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de mayo de 2023
Great little kettle,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We got this electric kettle for pour over coffee. We are two moths in and kettle has worked beautifully. It’s very stylish, looks great on the counter, heats up very quickly (it’s a tiny bit loud when the water boils), the water pours perfectly for P O coffee, it’s not so great when just pouring a cup of tea as it’s a slow pour and I’m impatient. It’s small so enough for two cups. I didn’t know I would love the temp dial and hold temp feature but it’s awesome. Seems well made and does not make the water taste funny after it is heated like some cheap kettles we have had",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de julio de 2021
Worth the Price,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Perfect for gong fu tea or a pour over coffee. It heats up quickly, and the ability to hold a temperature is invaluable for repeated steeps. The kettle pours somewhat slowly, which I have seen mentioned as a limitation in other reviews, but I find that the slower pour rate contributes to control and precision in the brewing process. I have also seen complaints about the material of the handle. While it is plastic it by no means feels cheap. The metal ring near the handle did burn me once, but I quickly learned not to grip so high. All the controls are easy to use. Further, the Stagg has an elegant and understated appearance that fits right in with the aesthetic of the tea ware I prefer. I recommend it highly to anyone who prefers excellence in their appliances.",artoffence,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de octubre de 2018
Best Kettle I've Owned so far,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I make a Chemex almost every single morning. I had been using a stovetop gooseneck kettle before I got this and am very happy with the purchase. It heats water fast, pours consistently, and is incredibly easy to use. I haven't had any trouble with mine heating water and use it every day, sometimes multiple times.

There are times it seems to have trouble maintaining the temperature but overall I haven't had too much trouble. The one drawback I have noticed is water boiling out if filled to the max line (not even above). It makes a mess and can be difficult to dry the base unit. Overall I love how this kettle works and how easy it is to make my morning cup of coffee.",Jared,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de enero de 2020
