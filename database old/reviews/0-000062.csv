Super easy to clean!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",Long story short it was the first cup of the day and I miss placed the cup in my keurig and the entire 10oz k cup brewed itself into an open counter space. Without this mat I would‚Äôve had a HUGE MESS to clean. But the mat soaked it all up and dried super quick. That gave me enough time to wake up before I had to clean my mess. The quality is amazin and I really like the non slip design. The top is super soft and holds a lot of spills. It is also very durable because I was scrubbing it hard and wringing it out to clean the coffee out of it. I put it in a medium dryer with two big dry towels for about 20 minutes and it was dry enough for use again.,Brittany Byrns,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de junio de 2024

Con: although the price is a tad high, I believe we would still order this again if need be.

I like,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been using this single mat for one week now, and I must say, it has proven to be an excellent addition to my coffee setup. I've placed it under my coffee machine, and it's the perfect size to accommodate not only my coffee machine but also my tamping station and more. It's great that I made sure to get the right size for my needs.

The functionality of this mat is impressive. It's been particularly useful as a base for my espresso-making activities. Even coffee drips don't seem to pose a problem. I've found that wiping up spilled coffee with a sponge or cloth is easy and effective. And even on occasions when I've forgotten to clean up a coffee spill, the mat manages to make the evidence vanish.

Initially, I was disappointed because I thought I had ordered the black version of the mat, but it turned out that I received the dark gray one instead. While this was my mistake, it did leave me a bit underwhelmed. However, considering the hassle of returning, I've decided to stick with it.

Overall, I'm quite pleased with my purchase, and this mat has significantly contributed to a cleaner and more organized coffee space, explicitly tailored for my coffee-related needs.",Lo,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de agosto de 2023

I live in a tiny home and noticed my wooden butcher block counters being affected by the moisture of my dishes coming through other mats I have used/dish towels etc. I have a tiny coffee maker too so I am using it for both dishes and as a coffee mat. I really needed an ABSORBENT mat that was EASY to clean and that would not get moldy or funky. THIS IS IT folks. It does not show water rings (yay!!) and the water/moisture does not go through the mat!!! It is a very pleasant shade of blue as well. Once a month I let it dry outside in the sun. It may not be necessary to do this but I like the idea of drying it out, completely, every so often. HIGHLY recommend.",Loveaboveallelse,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de enero de 2023

I thought the 17"" would be too large, but now I suspect it would have been perfect (assuming it is also smaller than advertised). I'm also a bit annoyed at the missing inch width-wise because it makes the coffee bar area slightly smaller.

Both the top and bottom have good grip, so it doesn't slide around and things on top of it don't slide around.
