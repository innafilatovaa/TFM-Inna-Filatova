Works okay but too small,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Nice quality and easy to use. It works okay, but I found it rather small and doesn't hold many grounds. I guess if you plan to make just a single 8oz cup this might be fine.",Dasdman,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de septiembre de 2022
Makes good coffee but requires patience (and filters!!),"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My husband is really gotten into trying to make the best cup of coffee lately. He's following James Hoffmann watching all his videos, and trying different coffee makers himself. We already had a collection of coffee makers, including a chemex and several pour-overs, but I bought this for him because we didn't have this exact maker. I personally don't like it very much but he's been using it everyday. What I don't like is that you have to pour a little bit, wait, pour a little bit, wait, pour little bit, wait just to make one cup of coffee. The basket portion is small so you just don't have any choice but to keep pouring a little bit at a time. I much prefer the Aeropress where I can pour the hot water, stir it a little bit, and I have my cup of joe.
If you like to tinker with pour time, fiddle with pouring patterns and that kind of thing you might like this. If you like to make a cup of coffee pretty quickly, this is not the maker for you.
It is very well made and I like that it's glass and can be cleaned with just a rinse.
You also need to get the filters that fit this maker. I saw a good tip somewhere that might help you if you're using this: when you need to get the coffee into the basket, if you already have an Aeropress, use the funnel for that to add the coffee to the Kalita. That way it won't end up with grounds on the wrong side of the filter.
Speaking of filters, mine did not come with any filters and I didn't order them at the same time, so I had we had to wait for my next order of the special filters to come. As previously mentioned, I don't have a lot of patience, so the 3-day wait for filters sort of irritated me. That's on me for not reading the product description, but hopefully you will know to order filters at the same time.
The coffee is good but I'm not patient enough to use this one. I'll probably end up buying the 185 too to see if I can tolerate how long it takes to make one cup of coffee with that.",H N Jones,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de agosto de 2022

Love it so far!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My favorite coffee mug has a wide mouth. My Melita one cup kept slipping off of my mug which would send hot coffee and grounds everywhere. I bought this in the hopes that it would fit more secure. The mouth of my mug is about 4 1/8"" wide.

I was torn on which size to purchase as the reviews said it's too small for even one cup. But, the larger size seemed too big for what I want, so I started with this one. It IS very small. I like to put 3 heaping teaspoons of coffee when making my cup. My mug holds 14 oz of fluid. I usually have about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of hot milk in the cup prior to making my coffee, so that leaves room for about 8-12oz of coffee.

The dripper fits perfectly on top of my mug. It might slide a little if I were to bump it, but it wouldn't go flying off. Big plus. It is small. 3 heaping teaspoons is a push, with adding water. I tried 2 teaspoons, but it didn't make the coffee strong enough to my liking. I can do the 3, but the water needs to be added very slowly, a little at a time. With my Melita I could fill it up and walk away - but of course if it slipped off my mug then that didn't work!

Bottom line for me: I feel like this makes a better tasting cup of coffee than my Melita. This is a little more work as I have to stay there and continue to slowly add water until it fills my mug. I really don't mind that. I don't love that I have to buy new filters as I have a ton of Melita still left. (I'm going to try out my Melita #2 filters in the Kalita and see how that goes). I love that this fits and won't fall off of my favorite mug. At this point I'm going to stick with this one and maybe get the larger one down the road.",MelindaN,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de enero de 2022

Is this thing a toy?,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I read plenty of reviews on this and I saw a couple that mentioned the larger was too big and that they had to get the small. I opened the box and thought oh, how cute. This is not a good thing. My cup of coffee in the morning is 25 grams of ground coffee to 400ml of water. The 25 grams came to the very top of this thing. Literally... to the top. There was literally no way for me to brew a cup of coffee with this tiny thing. I hear such great things about the Kalita Wave but it will be a few months before I can purchase the 185 so I am not at all happy. Who brews 7 to 10 grams of coffee? That isn't even a cup! Now I have this thing with a pack of filters, a waste of $30 combined that are unusable for me. Be warned, this may be a great option if want a wee tiny cup of coffee, but if you want to brew anything that has more than 10 grams of ground coffee do not purchase this thing.

Makes a great cup of coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been using a Melita pour over coffee brew cone for the longest time. I stumbled on the Kalita when researching pour overs. Since I always make around 8.5 ounce (240gr) of coffee (I use my daily serafino 12oz insulated coffee glass) I decided on the 155 model. I would have opted for ceramic but since it's not available I ended up with the glass. The steel one looks very cool but I prefer glass or ceramic if I have a choice. I have no issues at all with the wave 155. I rinse my filter before I add my ground coffee (white or brown). The filter stays nicely in place. I have no issues with overflowing. My standard recipe is 1:16 (15gr coffee / 240gr water). The coffee is perfectly hot and the glass Kalita actually retains the heat extremely well during the pouring process. Compared to the Melita I must say my coffee has gotten much smoother and taste so much better. I alternate between using a V60 which also gives me a very nice cup of coffee. Yes, the 155 is tiny but it's definitely adequate for that one 1 cup of coffee. It's also adorable and cute. It pairs nicely with the kalita 0.7l kettle.",Summerlin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de febrero de 2019

Fast and Easy to Use - No weird tastes,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I had to get this coffee dripper from somewhere else, as this package was lost in the mail.
I'll provide a review of the product though:

I've tried a few drippers before but this one made the coffee the best tasting and the smoothest. Each dripped I used, I used the same filer and same coffee amounts.
The last one I used was a plastic dripped and it seemed to have changed or added another taste to the coffee. It also made the coffee a bit bitter.
With this glass dripper, there is a significant change in taste from this glass dripper and the plastic one. This glass dripper makes a very smooth and authentic coffee taste.
It could be due to the shape of the dripper too, no ridges on the sides, 3 dripping holes instead of 1, and/or just that the material is glass and not plastic.

Kalita 155 makes *the best* single cup pour-over.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We own several pour-over styles (plastic, ceramic, paper filter vs. metal filter) and other various coffee-makers (french, espresso, percolating) Hands down this is the best one (single cup ideal because of the relationship between surface area of filter and rate of drip). This coupled with a goose neck, temperature-indicating, kettle and you'll never have to Buy. Coffee. Again. Ever. (Unless you're on the road, stuck for time, or there's power outage... well, you get the picture) My husband knows he can buy his favorite whole-bean coffee and just make it at home better than most places. CAUTION: You need to store this glass dripper in a safe place. If it falls from the cupboard, it will surely break.

Great cup of coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",Oh my gosh so I have gotten so many different coffee pour overs and French presses Aeropress and then I read about this and I ordered it and got it and I went oh my gosh this thing is so teeny but then I looked at videos on YouTube and stuff and let me tell you it makes a great cup of coffee especially if you're using fresh roasted coffee highly recommend this I'm going to get the bigger one when I can cuz I think it makes a better cup of coffee then the Hario V60,T.

Best Coffee I've Ever Made...prefer it even over French Press!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","French Press is probably the best device for making great coffee at home. The flavor notes are fantastic but I was never a fan of the heavy, muddy mouth feel. I finally decided to try a pour over though, honestly, I thought it was going to make mediocre coffee. Paper filters block some of the natural flavors of coffee.

At first, I struggled a bit with the filter swearing that they had made the filter too big for the glass cup. But I finally mastered that and the filter sits perfectly in the glass cup every time now. I have no special technique for the pour: I go near the edges to get the grounds stuck near the edges back into the brewing action and I pour in circles. I don't let the grounds ""rest"". I've never seen any difference in the results no matter what I do. But that's a good thing. I literally make a perfect cup of coffee every time!

The coffee brewed has the perfect body and mouth feel - very clean and absolutely good to the last drop as there is no residue in the coffee. It does lack some of the bright flavor notes of French Press coffee but I don't mind. The result from this pour over is extremely drinkable and enjoyable!

I have to strongly disagree with reviews stating the unit is too small. Every morning I use it to make a massive-arse 16+oz (?) Starbucks-logo mug of coffee. And there is room for me to add even more grounds if I wanted to go even a little bigger. And yes, I ""brew"" my coffee quite strong. So no complaints here at all.

Honestly, I don't think I'll ever use a different home brewing method other than this one. Brewing is simple though a little tedious and clean up is a breeze. I highly recommend you try this dripper!",Vince Neil,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de septiembre de 2017

Great,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The perfect size for a single cup of coffee. I made the mistake of first getting the Kalita 185,
figuring that I could make either more or less coffee. Then I purchased the Kalita 155.
For a single cup, from my experience, the Kalita 155 makes a better cup of coffee.
With the Kalita 155 you don't need to pour as far and the coffee and the brewing water stays hotter.
And, of course, you produce a hotter cup of coffee.
Consider instructions from Mr. Cho on using the Kalita. My proportions are 18g of medium/coarse
coffee and 310g of water. Also, be careful with the coffee ratings. Just buying the highest rating coffee doesn't ensure
that you will enjoy. Most of us getting into the coffee brewing haven't grown up on the more
complex coffees. If you're just interested in a good cup of coffee that tastes like coffee that
are most familiar with might look for coffees that aren't citrusy or described as complex
Two that brew into an enjoyable, relaxing cup of coffee are Valle Del Santuario and La Golondria from
Counter Culture; one from Columbia, the other from Peru. Balance with a well rated coffee from Ethiopia,
to compare to a more complex coffee. Make sure your coffees are fresh and make sure you grind properly.
Better to be a little coarse rather thanfine. Based on my experience, I can't emphasize this enough.
There is a lot of information explaining why this matters so much to final taste. Use a thermometer
or use water about 15 - 30 seconds off boil.",Annie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de marzo de 2017

The three small holes in the flat bottom help the brew cycle to make sure the water isn't just ""funneled through."" By far the best method I've found in that ever elusive search for the perfect cup of coffee.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is....its small. When they say 1-3 cups it's misleading. Most cups of coffee are 21-25 grams of grounds which fills up most of the filter paper. Nevertheless, perfect size for individual cups of coffe.",JJ,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de abril de 2016
Looking for dripper?,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","So you are looking for a dripper?

and you saw Hario v60, and think that is the one.

This one will be pretty good too. Also, if you are the only one who drinks pour over, 155 size is perfect.

Flavor? you should try, because everyone is different. What people are saying is this

Hario: brighter notes
Kalita: deeper flavor

So it is your choice.

However, if I have to stereotype, Kalita is considered more as ""coffee enthusiast's brand or professional brand"" while Hario is considered as typical profit-oriented corporation (Big Brand, you know what I am talking about) despite it's great products.

So choice is yours, better to get all of em. But if it's me, I will choose this.",CJ Park,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de agosto de 2014
Not optimal for really fresh coffee.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used the Hario V60 and the Beehouse drippers prior to using the Kalita Wave 155. I use 26 grams of coffee for my 12 oz cup. The Kalita Wave is barely big enough for that volume is you're using fresh coffee. The pre-wet and bloom pours will come right to the very top, so there is little room for error in that regard. I was skeptical of such a small dripper having 3 holes in the bottom, but using the Kalita spec filters the flow rate was okay and the finished cup pretty good. I would prefer it to be a bit slower and that the brew filter capacity were a bit larger to allow for more bloom.",CN,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de septiembre de 2016
