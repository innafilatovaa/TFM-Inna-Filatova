"Looks nice, works well just expensive","4,0 de 5 estrellas","A very nice looking way to make coffee works really well. Coffee tastes great.

Almost identical to my previous,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I loved .you previous chemex and this one is just about the same just slightly different spout.

Great item but glass is not thick enough,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used the Chemex twice and love it, but I'm really disappointed with how thin the glass is. Despite reading many reviews about its delicate nature and handling it with care, it chipped after making gentle contact with another item in the fridge after the second use. I couldn't believe how easily it chipped. I've used plenty of other glass pitchers over the years that have held up great, but not the Chemex.

For 3 cups a 6 cup chemex is a simpler path,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",This is a beautiful product and makes a great cup of coffee. I have found that using my 6 cup chemex is a better solution for getting 3 cups in the morning. The filters cost the same and do not require folding and I can pour in my 16 ounces of water into my 6 cupper and walk away. With the 3 cup the flute (top) is too small for 15 oz so I end up hanging out with my chemex to pour it a few times. To my tongue the taste is the same.,Placeholder,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de junio de 2024

"Clean coffee, better for environment","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have been making coffee in coffeemakers since I was 12. I was rewatching Mary Tyler Moore and noticed her beautiful coffeepot which happened to be a Chemex. When my coffeemaker died I decided it was time to get a more energy conscious appliance. I watched several YouTube videos on how to brew the coffee and I still haven’t bought a gooseneck teapot as I can’t justify the additional expense. I use my regular teapot and have the water come out the whistle hole. Works for me. I don’t believe I’ve gotten the grind down to the exact science, but I like doing experiments. I’m a baker, a chef, experimenting keeps my brain happy and you can’t really mess up coffee. Even with using the incorrect grind, the not recommended pour over spout, the coffee tasted cleaner. It tastes better. I love that I’m using less electricity and getting a better coffee experience.
I wouldn’t stop talking about it so much that my mother bought one too.",Elle M,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de mayo de 2024

Definitely more brittle than they used to be,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","First Chemex I got in 2012, thing moved with my 8 times, was knocked over and around plenty, cleaned and used daily. I finally broke it by it slipping while I was washing it 4 months ago and that I felt was fair and fully my fault. Bought this one as a replacement and here three months later barely tapped it against the faucet while washing it and it broke. I already had the distinct feeling the glass was thinner and more fragile and was being more careful with this one but I think I’ll be moving on to try to find a similar system that might have sturdier glass like the old chemex I had.",Devin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de abril de 2024
Old school and great coffee!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My Mother and I have used this coffee maker since the ‘70!!! With an electric kettle and coffee is moments from the time it takes to boil water! I use a stainless steel filter with this and a regular paper coffee filter to stop the bean sludge that can be at the bottom of a cup. But if you want that strong kick leave out the paper filter.
Please make it with Thicker Glass. These new ones can break easily if they are bobbled in the sink when washing. So beef them up please!! Too fantastic a product to cheap out on.",bbhills,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de abril de 2024
Best Coffeemaker I've Had,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I had originally ordered a different kind of pour-over coffeemaker, but didn't like the look/feel when it arrived. So went for the more recognizable brand and aesthetic shape.

I rarely post a review, but this makes great coffee. I ordered the mid-sized one as it's just my husband and I. I do entertain but have a French press I can use also when I need more servings. So this was bought for a nice AM leisurely coffee.

Not only is the flavor delicious, but also it's actually very easy to keep hot. I put my stove top on low (2 on my stove), and the Chemex has been perfectly fine sitting on there until I want a refill. When I'm ready for a second half cup or cup, it's hot.

Beautiful and elegant!!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This Chemex pour over carafe is so beautiful and elegant!!! I just love it. I was previously using a Mellita ceramic pour over, but was alarmed when I used my 365 UV light on it and it lit up blue in the glazing for lead! I dread thinking about how many times acidic coffee poured through that!! So I found this glass pour over which is just stunning, beautiful and elegant!! It’s perfect if I’m just making coffee for the 2 in my household or if I have some extra guests over - as it has ample capacity. The drip opening is intentionally large so that you’re forced to use their stronger paper filters (standard paper filters are likely to break). I have no intention of using their pricey filters. So I purchased an Ovalware paperless stainless steel pour over filter that’s compatible with Chemex and it works like a charm! I even removed the silicone rim on the stainless steel filter (because I don’t want to pour hot water over silicone - extra chemicals I don’t need) and it still fits just fine with no issues. To minimize messiness, I also use my cheaper unbleached/chlorine free “If You Care” paper filter inside the stainless steel filter so I can just toss the coffee without having to dig out the coffee grounds from the steel filter. I have a small kitchen without a lot of counter space, so this carafe stores very conveniently inside my kitchen cabinet alongside my dishes. One important issue - the glass overall is not very thick or hefty. It seems kind of delicate and should be handled with care. One good drop on a tiled floor and it’s finished! I kind of wish it had the glass heft of an Anchor Hocking glass mug for durability, but on the other hand the thinner glass gives it a very elegant look and feel.",L Mm,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de febrero de 2024

"Looks great, with a few major flaws","3,0 de 5 estrellas","Pros:

- Timeless look
- Makes decent coffee
- Good 3rd party ecosystem of accessories

Drawbacks:

- Difficult to clean, you WILL need a long-neck brush for this
- Glass is fragile (other reviews confirm this)
- Uninsulated, so coffee will go cold without a burner/hotplate

Owned the 8 cup Chemex for 3 years until it cracked last month (see pictures). I wasn't especially rough or careless with it, but using a stainless steel coffee filter may have caused this crack (either while inserting it or tapping it against the carafe). Looking around at other reviews, cracked/chipped glass is a common problem here. Take care when using this, especially around metal utensils.

Other than that, it's difficult to clean because of the narrow neck. Definitely buy the one with the glass handle instead of the wood/leather collar. Getting wood and leather wet repeatedly with soapy water will destroy them and taking off the collar every time is impractical. A silicone collar would have been a better choice. Lastly, consider a hot plate for this thing to keep coffee warm or a reusable steel filter.",Elliot Rowe,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de febrero de 2024
Showy but it makes good coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Vendor should include a couple of filters with each order so buyer can immediately make coffee. Filters are costly and not easy to find locally. On-line orders can take weeks for delivery. Order filters when you order the maker.

Easy to use for One to Two Cups (8/12 oz) of Coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I previously bought one of these from a different retailer, and this is my second purchase of the same product. Initially, I considered getting a smaller Chemex, but after giving it some thought, I opted for the larger size once again. The advantage of this Chemex is its capacity, allowing me to pour enough hot water over the 'big neck' to make one to two cups of coffee (8/12oz) with only a few brief pauses. The water drips through at its own pace, meaning I don't have to wait for it to finish before continuing to pour.

Cara ma ottima,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","La caraffa permette di produrre caffè all’americana (o alla tedesca) con i particolari filtri di carta “a cono” prodotti dalla stessa Chemex [B000N4W2SG] o compatibili.

Ci sono anche filtri metallici compatibili con questa caraffa [B09VPNK5LF] che permettono di risparmiare e produrre un caffè più corposo (ma anche più aggressivo nella bocca e sullo stomaco). In realtà, filtri in cellulosa ed in metallo non sono affatto equivalenti e producono bevande dal sapore molto diverso pur partendo dalla medesima miscela: più fruttate al gusto e trasparenti alla vista usando i filtri in cellulosa; più corpose e scure le bevande ottenute dai filtri in metallo.

Si lava sciacquandola: io preferisco senza sapone, perché la patina di caffè che rimane depositato, col tempo migliora l’aroma. Ma con un po’ di detersivo per piatti la caraffa torna sempre perfetta.

Alta la qualità e bello il design. Un po’ cara, ma dura 20’anni: vale la pena di prendere l’originale…

Must have,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We use our Chemex pour over pitcher every single day. While there are many pour over options available out there, this one suits our needs perfectly. The glass is well tempered and can withstand some accidental bumps and clinks without chipping. The wood wrap is also essential to not burn your hands when holding and pouring. Cleaning is fairly simple. We use a gentle sponge to scrub inside the base and swirl some warm water and dish soap in the rinse. There's been no issues with residue or staining.
We use the Chemex filters with this and we always get a perfect tasting cup of coffee. Granted, this does take a little longer than a traditional coffee or automatic maker, but it's worth the taste difference. We grind our own beans and use fresh water from our home filtration system. The result is smooth, high quality, delicious coffee. If there's some leftover, I will place a tea towel over the top to keep it warm.
My partner was never a big coffee drinker, but he has now become a pro at making this too and enjoys it just as much as I do.

Makes the best filter coffee in the world,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased a Chemex as I decided I wanted a filter coffee in addition to my daily espresso.

The product arrives wrapped tightly in a box just big enough for the Chemex.

It is beautifully designed, with a wooden neck collar wrapped around thick glass.

I use 84g coffee and this leads to the base being filled up. It makes the cleanest tasting coffee I've ever had in my life. In under 5 minutes you go from bean to cup including grinding time. A coarser grind is best, with the first 45 seconds to allowing the beans to bloom and release all gases. I then pour water over until 3 minutes 30 seconds, when I let any remaining water to filter through.

The Chemex paired with the Chemex filters produce one of the finest coffees I have ever had: smooth, crisp, strong and velvety. It allows you to taste all flavours in the roast you are using, and to experiment.

I had never used one before purchasing, and whilst daunting to use at first, the process of grinding beans, and pouring over water using a Hario Gooseneck spout kettle over the grinds has become a daily ritual, and one I enjoy greatly as it allows 5 minutes of relaxation and focus, of course followed by delicious cups of brown gold.

The only issue you may find it that the coffee does not stay warm for long, but I normally cover the top of the Chemex to keep temperature for longer. I definitely recommend the Chemex filters, as they work best for the product and are still good value.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en Reino Unido el 23 de diciembre de 2016

Pour un café au gout à l'échelle 1:1,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","En fait c'est tout bête , il s'agit d'une carafe en verre borosilicate dont la forme a été très bien étudiée pour éviter de mettre du liquide accidentellement à côté .
Il n'est absolument pas nécessaire d'utiliser les filtres de la même marque . J'utilise des filtres MELITA format 1X4 dont je replis les bords et que je fait tenir avec une pince à linge en bois naturel au dessus de l'anse et une autre en opposé juste à coté du bec verseur .
Le goût est absolument parfait car il n' y a pas de contact avec du plastique ou du métal lorsque l'on verse l'eau bouillante et lorsque le jus tombe dans le fond .
Donc cet objet pour moi est important car d'utilité sanitaire publique car aucun risque de s'intoxiquer avec du bisphénol A par ex. ou quelque métal oxydé que ce soit .
J'utilise une petite assiette générique en verre transparent comme couvercle que je pose doucement dessus .
J'ai pris le col bois/le lacet cuir qui permettent de donner plus d'allure et peut être lorsque c'est le cas l'ensemble protège de la chaleur ( sur ce dernier point je n'ai pas essayé car je ne bois pas de fluide brûlant ) , il n' y a aucun problème d'assemblage .
Il passe au lave vaisselle sans souci aussi .

Now this is coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Im an amateur coffee geek, there Ive said it, whew. What a relief. As a result of this, when Im at home I have many different ways to make coffee at my disposal. I had been looking at a Chemex for awhile, not sure how long, but I was intrigued by the simplicity of the device, and that it doesn't require its own power source, but with drip coffee makers, espresso machines, AeroPress, and French Press in my kitchen, I just didn't want to add another relatively large coffee device to my home. And then it happened. We were just about to come home from a recent vacation, where the coffee was free, but just ok, not even very good, the house sitter announced the disaster that she has encountered and was just about to be revealed. The French Press had fallen from the dish drying rack and broken. Oh the horror. Don't worry no house sitters were harmed in the making of this review.

Enter the chance at a Chemex. I ordered one and it arrived a few days later thanks to the wonders of Amazon Prime and UPS. A few days after that I had the opportunity to open the box and explore the new coffee gear. The coffeemaker itself is very simple. Just glass with a collar make of wood and retained by a leather thong, simple and utilitarian. The glass is of reasonable quality not quite as think as a pint glass, maybe the same quality as a mason jar. It is an attractive device with its smooth simple lines. When full its not a light pour, so I recommend a good grip on the collar, and if you have it, a finger on the stem of the lid.

Making coffee is simple, but not without work. The steps are simple in principle, add the filter, add the coffee, add the water and wait. However its not quite that straight forward. First, rinsing the filter is in your best interest. I recommend placing the filter into the vessel, and then rising it completely, wetting the entire paper, and then dumping the water maybe into a plant so its not just wasted. Doing this will help keep the paper pulp taste out of your coffee. You can skip this step, but you will know that you did this since there will be some chewed cardboard flavor in your cup, which I presume that you do not want. After the filter is in place, add the coffee. It can be any coffee really, Ive used drip grind and espresso grind just in my experimentation so far. These both work, but clearly the espresso grind will extend your brew time. From there you pour in the water. If you search for directions or watch videos on youtube you will see that there are many opinions on pouring water, who would have guess it, but yes, many people have many opinions on the right way to pour water. I pour the water in slowly, wetting the grinds fully and then letting them settle a bit before pouring more water. This is truly the most labor intensive part of this brewing method. Reason being that the top of the Chemex holds about 2 cups of water, so if you are making more than that you have a regular cadence of adding more water to the top as it brews and drains to the bottom. In this way this is not a fully unattended brewing method and it requires a bit more time dedicated to making the coffee. Its not long, and not hard, but just a different step for this device.

Once your desired amount of water has filtered through the desired amount of grinds, remove the filter, and you can pour the coffee into your favorite mug and drink. The resulting brew is very clean and very smooth. The filters do an amazing job of keeping all the silt out of the drink. The coffee is smooth and creamy, with lots of body and very litter bitterness. The Chemex holds the coffee indefinitely and when you've poured off the last of the coffee the bottom is clean since only the liquid coffee made it through. Just a quick rinse and its ready for the next brew.

Im glad that I have purchased this, and will continue to use this when I have a few (5-10 minutes) to invest in great coffee in the morning.

Makes Delicious Coffee!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","After being sickened by an electric drip coffee maker, I started searching for a coffee maker that didn't have a water reservoir or internal tubing that could harbor bacteria and/or mold. (Google 'Signs Your Coffee Maker Making You Sick' to learn more). I tried a Bodum pour over, but it didn't have enough capacity and I found that it was difficult for me to hold onto the thick collar. So I thought I would try the 10 cup Chemex with a handle. What I like about the Chemex is that it's plenty big enough, it looks nice, it's easy to clean, with the handle it's really easy to hold onto and pour, and it makes good tasting coffee (hard to believe I suffered with an electric drip coffee maker so long!).

Previously I'd read one or more reviews about the Chemex having thin glass that breaks easily, so I was hesitant to order one. But the glass in my Chemex doesn't look thin or cheap at all, and certainly not any thinner than any other glass coffee maker I've owned.

My only complaint about the Chemex system so far is that with the last 2 boxes of Chemex square filters I bought (at a retail store), I was shorted one filter in each box. So instead of getting 100 filters, the boxes only had 99 filters in them. At this point I don't know if the problem is with someone at the retail store who has been pilfering one filter out of each box hoping no one would notice, or if the problem is with the factory. I notified the store manager today and I plan to call Chemex tomorrow so they can look into the problem. Hopefully they get this straightened out because the Chemex filters do make a smooth tasting cup of coffee!",Kat Rose,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de octubre de 2018

AMAZING! Didn't know what we were missing!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Ok, I wanted to give this coffee maker a little time before I posted my review; in order to get used to this new (old) way of making coffiee. After having it for almost 2 months now, I can say that we LOVE it! Our 2 year old, 100 buck, ""high end"" POS maker crapped out. So we were looking for an alternative to the norm, tired of vinegar cleaning, and spending $$$, and boy did we find it! Thoughts below:

Quality of item - It is very high quality and has held up very well. BE SURE that you buy a genuine Chemex brand and NOT a cheap knock off! They exist out there. A friend of ours mistakenly bought a knock off, and its quality is no where near the quality of Chemex. The knock off is too thin and easily cracks and breaks. Beware! As for this brand, no complaints at all. It has held up beautifully, and we make at least 1 pot a day.

Time it takes to brew - Ok, the MAIN thing is that you have to boil water in a kettle, and manually feed it water of course. So, whatever time that takes on your stove to boil a kettle, that's the time you can add to what it would normally take you to make coffee in an electric maker. For us, we timed both. What we found is that it takes us approximately 5 minutes longer to make a pot of coffee in the Chemex, due to the time it takes to boil the water, mostly. Manually pouring it is a sunk cost, obviously. As for the maker itself, it takes about the same time as an electric maker, or perhaps even less. BUT, the difference in the quality of coffee is AMAZING! We use Folgers Columbian and when brewing via the Chemex, it tastes, smells, and ""feels"" like Starbucks! No joke. Never got that quality out of an electric maker, ever. So, is it worth the extra 5 mins and a bit of labor? YEP!

Filters and such - When we bought this maker, we also bought the traditional Chemex paper filters to go with it. We also took the advice of others and bought the metal mesh filter for it too, which is a bit costly. Using the traditional papers filters was rather time consuming. They are thick and, while they do produce an amazing coffee, they are very slow. So, we decided to use the metal filter. Problem with using the metal filter alone is that the holes in it are large enough to let fine sediment through, and it's also too quick; meaning that the coffee grounds do not get a chance to really saturate and release the coffee robustness, and flavor... So... what to do? Well, what we found is that if we buy standard #4 cone type coffee filters, combine it with the metal filter (placing it on the inside of the metal filter of course), we get the best of both worlds. The #4 filters are thick enough to hold the water in longer, but not too thick so the flow is better. The metal filter ""stiffins"" the #4 filter and also catches any loose particles that might escape the #4 filter. The result - We capture the full flavor of the coffee, and save $ in the long run because #4 filters can be bought anywhere, and cheaply. We use the unbleached #4's.

Keeping coffee hot - When we brew a pot in the Chemex, we immediately transfer it from the Chemex to a thermos type coffee carafe. Since the temperature is near boiling when the pot is brewed, the coffee stays hot in the carafe all day long. We bought the glass lid for the Chemex, but mostly use it to keep dust out of the Chemex when it's not in use. Plus, it looks nice on top of it ;)

Clean up - We simply rinse it out after letting it cool down a bit... done.

Looks on the counter - Ok, here's a NICE side benefit! The Chemex is like a beautiful art glass sculpture. It looks WAY better than that ugly, clunky, looking device that we used to have. Plus, it takes up about 1/2 the room on the counter! So, we have more space now ;) And, we didn't have to sacrifice quantity of coffee. This 10 cup Chemex is precisely the amount our old clunker made.

Bottom line - Never knew what we were missing. AWESOME coffee, even using cheap brands, every time! The aroma that fills the air in the home when we brew is amazing. Love the smell! AWESOME looks in the kitchen! NO MORE ""vinegar clean out, stinking up the house - finally self-destructs"" coffee makers! This baby, taken care of and not dropped or thrown across the room, should last a lifetime! This means NO MORE spending 80-100 bucks every couple of years on ugly mechanical, mad scientist, POS devices. Talk about saving $$$!!! Is it worth the upfront costs, and spending 5 more mins to make coffee, and feeding the maker as opposed to automatically doing it for you? Um..... YES! Totally worth this minor, manual, labor and costs in my opinion. I can't tell you what a great feeling it was to toss that 100 buck, mechanical, coffee maker wannabe POS into the recycling bin! My joy was palpable :)

A side note - This is making coffee like most people living today have little experience with. You've likely never experienced coffee made like this ever in your life, nor know anyone who has. I know we hadn't, and didn't! Therefore, the process IS different and it DOES take some getting used to. This is why I waited nearly 2 months to write this review. Give it time... get used to the process... follow the directions they provide, and you'll likely never go back to an electric maker again. It is well worth the benefits we believe and whats more is, at least for us, the manual process seems to lend itself to a more ""personal"" and ""creative"" experience with the coffee making process. I know that sounds strange, but for us it's more like we're ""creating"" a wonderful coffee to enjoy. Like a painter with their brush. The Chemex is a tool, and a beautiful one, but the ""artwork"" you create with it is up to you ;) Enjoy.

Hope this review helps! Also, thanks to all the others who have left reviews! You helped us to make our decision! Glad we did!",Deal Grabber!,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de febrero de 2016
Chemex and its Filters (Hack),"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I just bought my first Chemex because after a half life of French press and Italian espresso makers, I read that only filtering really gets rid of the more damaging ingredients of coffee. Now obviously not drinking any was not an option, nor was the good old coffee machine (its plastic filter is a problem in its own).
So on to Chemex... Now some research into its specific filters made clear: Not only can they be difficult to resource, they are also incredibly (like outrageously) expensive. Although that may be due to the current pandemic and its hunger for masks, I thought there must be an alternative...
After googling what a filter is usually made of (Cellulose) and whether white (bleached) is better/worse than brown (unbleached) and which of the shape of filters (square or triangle/cone) works better, I opted for white and square and was looking into filter papers (laboratory supplies, paper mills) by the sheet in large quantities... That, however, also meant significant costs for large bulk, folding myself and shipping costs as well as the issue of storage. Not knowing how to proceed, out of necessity, I just tried the large white IKEA FANTASTISK paper napkin, which I LOVE and always have at hand. Guys... what can I say, it just worked perfectly and they are 2 Euro for 100 pcs. A small disclaimer though, I didn't brew a full batch of coffee in my 8 cups Chemex yet, just 2 cups (which is what I drink in the morning). So this hack still does need to prove itself when brewing a full can with obviously heavier grounds. Doubling the napkin might be necessary for a full batch.
A few things to keep in mind:
- white bleached napkins are compostable (chlorine is no longer used for bleaching, oxygen is...)
- bleached tends to get rid of the natural wood ingredients which seams to be beneficiary for the taste of your coffee
- you need!! to follow the instructions for brewing with Chemex (pouring hot water first to clean the filter and ""glue it to the glass"" while simultaneously warming the glass container) as well as how to gently pour.
- the 3 layers of the napkin need to face the pouring channel of the Chemex.

An excellent visual instruction for brewing with the Chemex can be found at Lisa Bryant from Downshiftology at her site as well as YouTube (I'm a fan but in no way related).
Hope this helps and hope the napkin holds its promise when brewing full portion. My cup of coffee was the best I had in a long time.",Arteberlina,Revisado en Alemania el 18 de febrero de 2021

Why buy this-Chemex is easy to use-makes foolproof coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","**Updated 01/01/20** This is a superior coffee brewing system. Using the Chemex brewer with their filters will make good coffee taste even better, smoother, and will markedly improve mediocre or badly ground coffee. It does take some time to brew manually with the Chemex but the way the brewer is designed allows it to extract maximum flavor, no bitterness from coffee. You need 195-205-degree water, wet the grounds with the heated water and let ""bloom"" for 45 seconds to 1 minute, then dump the rest of the water in up to the brim a couple more times and that's it.
Cleanup/maintenance is so easy, throw away the grounds/filter (they can both be composted), rinse out/air dry the brewer and you're done.
Get one with the built in glass handle-not the wood collar and I recommend their square white filters (the FS-100 for this model brewer) that are ""bleached"" with an oxygen cleansing process so there are no chemical or cleaning residues left over in the filters. I do not recommend the unbleached brown filters as they leave a noticeable ""paper"" taste in the brewed coffee.
**Side notes** I’m in a hurry in the morning to get my lunch/stuff ready and make coffee to take with me in thermos cups for the day. You do not need to overthink and complicate the Chemex brewing process like most articles-YouTube videos show and do not need a scale to weigh the coffee grinds or water.

*How much coffee grinds to water: The following ratios are approximately what Chemex recommends on their website. (2 level tablespoon scoop is 10 grams-1 level tablespoon scoop is 5 grams. A cup is 5 oz. or 142 grams of water). You can start with these and adjust accordingly for a stronger brew.
The 8-cup brewer takes 4 level 2 tablespoon scoops of grinds to 40 oz. of water. The 10-cup brewer takes 6 level 2 tablespoon scoops of grinds to 50 oz. of water.
“Bloom” the grounds first. Pour in just enough water to wet the grounds, let sit for 45 seconds to 1 minute. The grounds will bubble/swell-rise/then sink which allows CO2 gas (that tastes sour) to escape. After bloom time, simply pour water in up to brim 3 or 4 times more to make a full pot. No fancy pouring techniques-equipment or limited water level to soak grounds procedures are required.

* If I have a little too much water to grinds ratio it does not change the flavor much, if at all. Sometimes I deliberately overfill the carafe and essentially turn the 8-cup brewer into 10 cups. The brewed coffee will rise up to and around the grounds filter-close to the brim. Gingerly lift out the filter with soaking/wet grounds (while still brewing) and pour some into a cup to make room in the carafe for the overflow.
*The water needs to be 195 to 205 degrees and I use the Miroco 100% Stainless Steel, 1.7 Liter Temp Control Electric Kettle to heat/keep water heated while brewing. Have also boiled water in stove top kettle, allow to cool for 30 seconds after reaching boil and brewed this way.

*Type of grind: Chemex recommends a medium coarse grind. Best extraction/grounds soak time should be about 4 minutes according to experts. I usually grind the beans with a Baratza Encore electric grinder set on 22. Sometimes use the Hario Skerton Pro hand grinder. Have also tried a cheap ordinary blade grinder. The Chemex filtering system will still make great tasting coffee even with blade ground coffee. Interestingly, America’s Test Kitchen did a taste test with burr ground coffee vs ordinary blade ground coffee, the tasting experts had a hard time detecting the difference.

*The Chemex carafe is glass (tough, durable, borosilicate glass) so naturally it can and will break if you drop it or bump it hard. This is a con, not much to say about this. Once upon a time, a long ago, I dropped a stainless-steel electric percolator and it broke-quit working. In 5 years of using a Chemex I’ve only broken 1 carafe. I always have a spare carafe on hand in case I crack or break it. The added cost of having an extra carafe is worth it so I can always have the superior coffee the Chemex brews.",MS,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de abril de 2018
A regular joe drinker's review,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I'm not what most would consider a coffee connoiseur. I simply enjoy great cups of coffee.

I've had the great honor of having amazing coffee throughout europe, at many 5-star hotels, in dive coffee shops that know what they are doing, and the best coffee ever at the Blue Bottle in San Francisco. These are things I have purchased, not made.

At home I have, historically, simply bought middle-of-the-road pre-ground coffee and put it in a normal ""set it and forget it"" braun coffeemaker. I then typically add a bit of sugar and some half and half. Done.

However, I grew tired of the inconsistency I felt I'd get from that process and the middling cups of coffee. Sometimes too weak, sometimes too bitter.

So I started looking into the more ""old school"" ways. The french press and handpouring. Obviously, the chemex was my choice and I received it on Christmas Day 2011, so this review is after using it now maybe 15 times.

I love the simple design - it's basically a very thick beaker with a beautiful wooden wrap-around and a simple leather strap. The glass has an outstanding sunken fluid slide built into it for pouring - it pours outstanding. It's these little things that you really enjoy every morning.

I watched a simple youtube video on use. It's fairly straightforward. It takes 6 total minutes to make the coffee and no additional time compared to a automatic drip - I'm serious, I timed it. I put 2 cups of water into a tea kettle and put it on heat, put the filter in the chemex, 4-5 scoops of coffee (still learning the precise amount I like), and then get the coffee cup out, put sugar and half and half in it, and by then the tea kettle is usually almost at the perfect temp.

... You can learn the right way to pour the water in via youtube.

The results:

Coffee is flavorful and rich and amazingly lacking of bitterness. I've heard this is from the filter - catching the bitter oils much better than normal filters. But the coffee is simply very good.

If you expect coffee to stay hot in a glass beaker, you will not be pleased - it won't stay hot. Use a thermos if you want it kept warm without heating it somehow.

There's nothing to clean - just rinse it out each time and it's good to go. No plastic tubes to worry about. The filter catches all the grounds, so those aren't floating around anywhere.",Joe O,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de enero de 2012

Chemex FTW - With Some Advice,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This Chemex was purchased to replaced a French Press, which I adore, but I grew tired of picking grounds out of my coffee. Like other reviewers here I too had a Keurig which I absolutely hated because it didn't work more than it did. Anyhow, when I opened the package I was a little intimidated because I had watched around 50 videos about how to prepare coffee with a Chemex and to be honest, it looked really complicated. Now that I've made coffee a few dozen times and I really like my Chemex I'll share what I learned.

The glass handled Chemex truly is great. I've seen lots (and lots) of video of people struggling to maneuver the Chemex with the leather collar and it's not pretty. The handle is functional and does not get hot and the whole thing is washable.

The Chemex filters are really a must. I purchased these Chemex Coffee Filter Fits Most Conical Filter Coffeemakers - 100 Bonded Oxygen Cleansed Prefolded Filters on the recommendation of another Amazon customer and they work beautifully. Many websites and blogs state that they use other store brand filters that work just the same, but eventually they would state that they use two filters at a time or that they have filters break on a regular basis. Just buy the Chemex filters!

As for directions, seriously, follow the directions on the packing insert. Chemex knows what they're talking about! After watching all those videos filled with pretentious coffee snobs I simply followed the directions on the Chemex packaging and I got a really good cup of coffee. There was no fancy water pouring technique, no crazy coffee grinding (I use Douwe Egberts) and no insane coffee swirling to get oxygen in. I put coffee in, water on top, and let it drip.

Excelente método de extracción,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Es una encantadora cafetera, el mango de Bambú es muy térmico al calor, la capacidad hasta antes de llegar a la ""cintura"" del matraz es de 1500 mL así que podrás preparar varias tazas de café, para mi caso bebo bastante café entonces por ello pedí la versión de Chemex de 10 tazas, el cuero que sujeta al matraz es de cuero, recomiendo fotografiar como está sujeto el nudo para volver a colocarlo igual cuando hagan una limpieza, yo no lo aprieto demasiado para no dañarlo, lo esencial es que sólo sujete en su lugar a las partes de Bambú, el matraz inferior es ancho eso me gusta, el cristal es grueso y se mira resistente, el único detalle con este tipo de cafeteras de cristal es que en todas hay que tener mucho cuidado al lavarlas, en el caso de este Chemex cuido de no golpearlo con otra cosas cuando lo lavo en el fregadero, aunque he llegado a dar ligeros golpes y no ha pasado nada, para lavarlo ocupo un cepillo de la marca Tupperware, que por su forma y longitud es excelente y el mango es plástico por lo cual no habrá problema al lavar al Chemex ya que no lo golpeará, por ello recomiendo lavar el Chemex con cepillos de mango de plástico o madera. Yo hago dos tipos de limpiezas, la limpieza ligera que es solamente enjuagar 1 o dos veces el Chemex con agua caliente al terminar de ocuparlo y luego dejarlo bocabajo para que escurra, esto ahorra tiempo y trabajo al estar quitando el collar de madera y el cordón de cuero a cada momento, y la otra limpieza que hago es la limpieza profunda, esta la hago cada semana y es cuando quito el collar y el cordón y lavo todo con jabón en polvo suave neutro y el cepillo de limpieza, esto le doy su tiempo pues el estar quitando y colocando el collar de madera lleva su tiempo. En conclusión el Chemex lucirá precioso en tu estantería o café bar, así luce, es hermoso, clásico y da ese aire de elegancia y excéntricismo para preparar un café, no te arrepentirás si lo compras, hay otras imitaciones de cafeteras parecidas al Chemex no he tenido ninguna pero te aseguro que no son de la calidad original de la que está hecha el Chemex, la madera es auténtica, el único detalle es en el precio de los filtros, aquí en México rondan los 25 dólares por 100 piezas, lo que a la larga superarán el precio de la Cafetera (85 dólares) es por eso que adquirí un filtro de acero reutilizable aquí en Amazon, es el filtro que es de orilla color naranja, me ha funcionado muy bien y me ahorrará con el tiempo el depender de los filtros, claro el sabor cambia con un filtro de papel y otro de acero, pero eso es otro tema. En conclusión si has llegado a este punto compra el Chemex, no te arrepentirás de hacerlo.",Enkil Pardo ϟϟ,Revisado en México el 11 de octubre de 2021

Makes great coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","After trying to up my coffee game by a combination of better coffee + better brewing methods, I settled on a Chemex pourover as it was recommended by many coffee afficionados. I had previously brewed with drip methods and then a french press, but didn't love how the french press left sediment in my coffee. It is true this method produces a very clean, clear cup of coffee - I really like it and am now hooked on this method! It is not super time-consuming, and it makes your morning coffee almost ceremonial - like when making a matcha tea - there is a process involved but not overly labor intensive and well worth it! I originally purchased the traditional model (that has the wood handle) which I loved. Unfortunately it broke when I knocked it over one morning and so I wanted to order another one ASAP but that one was out of stock so I got the glass-handled one. It functions the same and is also stylish, I just prefer the traditional wood-handled one based on appearance and also it feels ""heftier"" than this one, which feels much lighter. Regardless, it brews an excellent cup of coffee! Be aware that 3 cups refers to three 5oz cups (so 15 oz total) which is like one large mug, so this is perfect if you're just brewing 1-2 'cups' for yourself in the morning - if you need to make more you'll need the larger model.",D,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de junio de 2020
Mindful coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","After buying another electric drip coffee maker that died after two years, we elected to go non-electric. Our current coffee is a bit too finely ground which slows the process down but the coffee is as good as from drip machine. Although it is easier to put everything in a machine and push a button, we enjoy making and drinking the coffee from the chemex.

High quality glass!

You do need a heat pad to hold and help pour as it is very heavy and hot when full.

Sometimes the filter sucks into the pour spout and prevents the coffee from dripping into the pot. We solve this by placing a straw between the filter and side.

"Incredible Flavor, Energy Efficient, Easy to Use and Clean","5,0 de 5 estrellas","Although it was designed in 1941, Chemex coffee pots remain the simplest, most easy to use coffee maker on the market. And the high-quality Chemex filters allow you to “espresso” grind without tears or grounds in the pot.

I finely grind my French Roast beans and pour the ground coffee into the filter. Then I place my Chemex on a cast iron plate on my stove top at low (2) heat and pour the hot water over the grounds.

You will need to discover your own coffee strength through trial and error. I like my coffee strong and I like the fine grind that creates all the flavor I’m looking for as the water quickly passes through the grounds.

The improvement in coffee flavor is incredible. Strong, smooth and no bitterness.

Chemex uses less energy than my old percolator (which took about 15 minutes of energy to brew) We have a hot water tap and now I just get a cup of hot water from the sink and pour it over.

It’s easy to clean—see my picture above—once a week I put a couple tablespoons of vinegar in and fill it with hot water to let it soak. That helps remove any kind of coffee residue. About once a month I shake a little bit of Bon Ami into the bottom of the pot, add water, add a paper towel and use a wooden spoon to swirl off any build up. It’s an easy, two-minute operation and the results are like new, and sparkling! Easy to wipe the exterior to a sparkle too!

It’s beautiful to look at. But respect the glass: It should be handled only by experienced hands. Every few years we knock it off the counter and it breaks then we hurriedly replace it because we are spoiled by the great flavor and ease of use.

Coffee afficianados, stop looking for another pot: in Chemex you will discover your coffee Nirvana. But remember, Nirvana is not achieved in a day.","Catherine Metzger, Founder, Food for the Ages",Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de noviembre de 2020
Very well constructed and designed.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I'd encountered this type of pot while visiting people, and discovered how amazing the coffee was that resulted. I have tried a few different methods of making better coffee, but most have been negligibly different from regular percolated coffee. French press was probably the worst failure, producing a strong coffee, but one filled with sediment.

There are a number of off-brand glass carafes like this that try to emulate the original Chemex, but reading reviews of them makes it clear that they're significantly inferior. The wooden handle wrapping this carafe never gets hot, fits the carafe perfectly, and is made of two wooden pieces held in place by the leather cord. It's very hard to tell from the pictures, but there's also narrow fluting to one side of the carafe that creates a perfect channel to pour out the very last of the contents in a controlled and steady stream. The fluting alone is worth the extra investment since without it you'd either have a small amount of liquid stuck in the bottom, or you've to turn the carafe completely upside down and have an uncontrolled waterfall of the remaining liquid coming out from all around the rim.

The real secret to the coffee is the filters however. All the carafe sizes have a fixed shape and angle to the top half of the carafe so they can fit a single filter shape. The filters are much thicker than most and come in a few different varieties. Since the secret of the coffee is the filters, don't bother buying this product if you plan to purchase a permanent metal filter since the quality of the resulting coffee will be significantly inferior.

An notable oddity of the Chemex brand carafe is their sizing. They assume a 5 oz cup size, which is patently ridiculous, so the 10 cups size is 50 oz when absolutely full. Chances are you're not going to want to completely fill the carafe however, so buying a slightly larger size than you usually use is perfectly reasonable. The shape of the carafe itself means that exactly half of the volume is within the bottom 1 inch, denoted by a small glass nub in the carafe, so anything half full or less visually seems like a minor difference.

My only guess for why such a small cup size is assumed is because of how they recommend the measuring of grounds. They suggest one Tbsp (scoop) of grounds per cup of coffee (5 oz), which is a huge quantity of grounds compared to most coffee machines/processes. This seemed ridiculous until I tried the coffee with the Chemex brand filters and realized the complete lack of bitter to the coffee. If you've been looking for a way to get the European style coffee that's extremely strong but not bitter, this is the only way I've found. The high grounds per output volume makes the coffee stronger, something that you'd normally limit to prevent the bitterness from being overpowering, but with the filters this carafe uses you can make it that strong and still not have bitter coffee.

Notably, this product is not dishwasher safe. In fact, it's not really even sink washing safe. The leather thong used to hold the wooden handle in place cannot reasonably be removed, and should be kept out of water to maintain it's lifespan. The glass is good quality however and since the filters have removed anything from the coffee that would cause staining of the glass in the short term, a swirling rinse of the inside with regular tap water after each use is sufficient to keep it clean for an extended period of time. After that, a special brush is needed to reach the inside walls of the lower portion of the carafe, since the neck is too narrow for even the smallest of adult hands.",Michael Alexander,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de junio de 2015

Simple to Use - Delicious Coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I was totally disgusted with having to purchase a drip coffee pot about every six months & started researching other methods of making coffee. Came across the Chemex pot & had never even heard of it before. I did a lot research & found many different websites giving it good reviews. Here is my take on the Chemex so far.

It will take some getting used to. If you are one of those that have to rush out the door 5 minutes after you wake up, then it will be best to wait until the weekend when you have time to get to know your Chemex & set up your own routine. Yes, it is slower than a drip coffee pot is, but hey, those drippers start getting slow in a couple of months anyway.

The couple of extra steps will be worth it when you taste that cup of wonderful coffee.

Suggestions:

Look on youtube for "" Using a Chemex coffee maker"" - there are many videos out there to get you familiar with the process.

Purchase a box of the Chemex filters....others will just not do - maybe you better purchase 2 boxes & get it over with...some folks said they were hard to find. WARNING - there are no ""freebie"" filters enclosed with the coffee pot!!!

You will need some sort of ""long spout"" pouring vessel to pour your hot water over the grounds...I am using a little plant watering can until my Hario water kettle arrives...did not like to pay the high price for it, but I am committed to using my Chemex coffee pot for a very long time, so I just broke down & bought a Hario water kettle. The you tube videos shows folks using this pot, it is for sale here on Amazon.

You will find other sites selling the Chemex pot a few dollars cheaper, but then you have to pay for postage, Amazon has free postage on this item & I have had very good luck purchasing things here.

Be careful with the pot, it is glass & I can see how it could easily break if you are still sleepy & not too coordinated when you first wake up. You can purchase a hand blown pot, but it only comes with the leather collar....not with the glass handle. I really wanted the hand blown pot, but I did not want the leather collar thing...I just wanted to keep it as simple as possible & other reviews said the leather collar starts fading after awhile. The only purpose of the collar is to have a place to grab a hold of the pot without burning yourself. The other option is a pot with a glass handle, which is what I got. Glad I got that one, even though I liked the original look.

Ebay has some old Pyrex ones made in the US, but they are going for high prices & of course, they will have the original collar. The new ones are not made in China, but don't remember exactly where. Also, the new ones are not Pyrex.

Bottom Line:

Very happy with my Chemex...I will NEVER go back to a drip pot..",Charlotte Stout,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de enero de 2012

You control the variables,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","In a nutshell, that's the big plus for this. You can control the coffee, the grind, the brew temperature, the beans, you name it. If you have a coffee grinder, great. That is the simplest way to control the grind. Even a whirly bird (blade) grinder should work fine with this coffeemaker. If not, then find a shop that sells fresh beans that will grind them for you. If you buy the canned reground coffee, you probably use an automatic drip maker, so go no further.

I was just in a Whole Foods today that has coffee beans with their roast date on the dispensers. They have a grinder right there. Buy a few ounces of coffee and grind it. Purists say roast beans should be used within 15 days of their roast and within 15 minutes of their grinding. In spite of what I read against it, I find I can extend coffee's life several fold by refrigerating or better freezing it. YMMV, as they say.

You need a thermometer calibrated to the boiling point of water. If you are working in Fahrenheit water will boil at 212° minus 2° for every 1000 ft above sea level you are. I said that because you need to verify the calibration of your thermometer by dipping the tip into actively boiling water.

1. Open the filter and put the 3 layer side against the channel. That channel is there to allow air displaced by incoming water to escape from the brewer so you don't bubble coffee on everything and so you don't build up a positive pressure which would slow filtering.

2. Preheating the Chemex by pouring boiling water through the filter. I like to use at least 12 ounces in my 48 oz Chemex. Don't forget to discard this water before you start filtering. Voice of experience.

3. Measure the volume of water you will be using to brew your coffee and heat in the microwave, in an electric hot pot or on the stove.

4. While the water is heating I grind my coffee. I generally measure my coffee using beans rather than ground coffee. Sometimes I weigh them instead. Go ahead and add the ground coffee to the filter.

5. When the water boils, I remove it from the heat and begin measuring its temperature. The ""standard"" brewing temperature is 195 to 205 degrees F. If my beans were frozen, I'll cheat a little to the high side. This is one area where you can ""break the rules"" to get a coffee you like. Some say brew a darker roast at a lower temperature and a lighter roast at a higher temperature. You're the boss.

6. Discard preheat water and begin by pouring a small amount over your grounds. If your beans are good and fresh they will bubble (""bloom"") when you pour that first water. The general idea is to get all the grounds wet before you begin the Pour.

7. The Pour. Note the time or start a timer. Fill the V nearly full. I like to pour away from the center and track that around nearer the circumference. I almost always will stir using a spoon or whatever implement is handy. Keep the V nearly full either by pouring frequently or very slowly, distributing the water around more or less evenly.

8. If all went well, somewhere around 4 minutes just about all the coffee has dripped through. Enjoy your coffee!

If your coffee finishes through the filter in less than 4 minutes, you want a finer grind coffee. If it takes too long, you want a coarser grind.

I generally pour my coffee into a vacuum bottle so I can enjoy it over the next few hours. Rather than discarding my Chemex preheat water I simply use it to preheat my thermos.

Cleanup is easy. Glass washes clean and often I get by with only a rinse. It is glass and will break. I avoid following hot coffee with cool rinse water. One down side for the Chemex is the filters are relatively expensive. I often will get multiple uses from my filters by rinsing them in hot tap water and allowing them to air dry. I notice no ill affects on flavor by doing this but your experience may be different. There are cloth and metal alternatives to the filter paper. Both of these allow more sediment into your cup than does paper. Coffee presses allow for similar level of control as the Chemex. When I want clean coffee I use the Chemex with paper. If I don't mind the sediment I use the press.",Charles Mc2,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de junio de 2014
Aromatic Rich-Tasting Coffee at Home,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","As I'm typing my review I'm sipping on my coffee that I made using the Chemex 10-cup. I am a serious coffee lover and have purchased quite a few products (e.g. french press, regular coffee maker, Bialetti stovetop espresso maker) but they all pale in comparison to the Chemex. Here's my take on this lovely gadget:

POSITIVES
**Delicious tasting coffee. I purchase whole beans at my favorite coffee shop. I use this grinder Hario Coffee Hand Grinder Skerton to hand-grind the beans. Using the Chemex filter, I add a dash of salt (according to Alton Brown a dash of salt brings out more flavor). I use this electric tea kettle Chef's Choice 677 Cordless Electric 1-3/4-Quart TeakettleChef's Choice 677 Cordless Electric 1-3/4-Quart Teakettle to boil the water. Once everything is made I sit, open the kitchen windows, and sip my coffee. It's heavenly!

**This process helps me to slow down in the morning. Yes, I wake up 30 minutes earlier because there are extra steps in making a Chemex coffee, but let me tell you this: waking up earlier is worth it! I'm able to slow down, watch the deer eating the grass out on my front yard, and enjoy the cool, crisp morning air. I believe coffee is meant to be enjoyed, not gulped within five minutes and this Chemex allows for the slow-down of time.

**Easy clean up. Just as the other reviewers noted, there is minimal clean up. I love the fact that it's easy to clean, there's no spare parts or hard-to-reach nooks and crannies where mold loves to fester. And yes, avoid wetting the leather strap; it hardens it.

**Affordable. With store-bought coffee (my favorite coffee shop sells a 16-oz drip coffee for $2) rising in price, I couldn't keep forking over cash on a daily basis when I know there's an alternative method. I'm a teacher and money is tight so I saved my pennies, bought this Chemex, the filters, the tea kettle, and the grinder and now I'm saving money.

NEGATIVES
**Gets cold easily. Yes, the open glass of the Chemex allows head to escape and rapidly cools down the coffee. To solve this problem I purchased this carafe Leifheit Columbus 2000 Chrome 1 L / 34 OZ/28307 (in blue) ... and problem solved! Now my husband can enjoy piping hot coffee hours after I've made it and left for work.

**Multi-step method makes for a slow process. Yes, it takes time to brew coffee in this manner. But, trust me, it's worth the extra effort. Every cup tastes just as good as my favorite coffee bistro, hands down! But this time, I don't have to pay more for another cup.

**Getting the right balance of coffee beans to water ratio. It took me a couple tries -- and a couple of watered-down coffee -- to figure out the balance I prefer. As of now, I use dark roast whole beans and my ratio is 8oz per 2 TB whole bean coffee. I grind my beans a little finer than coarse because I like my coffee rich in flavor. So far, so good.

OVERALL
I am so happy with this purchase. With all the expensive coffee gadgets out there I'm surprised I never heard of Chemex until just a few months ago. I am now a bonafide Chemex coffee lover and this method of brewing coffee is now my standard. And just as Yo Gabba Gabba pines, ""Try it; you'll like it!"" I hope you will too.",Jenn P,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de mayo de 2013

MY beloved coffee maker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is my second Chemex. I bought my first one about 2 years ago. That one broke when it was placed on the counter, beneath a cabinet of spices. I was cooking and accidentally bumped one of the glass spice jars and it landed right on top of the Chemex and broke the top. Went right to the internet and bought another one within hours.

Chemex has the best system for coffee. It's simple, the coffee is spectacular, it's quick to make and clean up is easy. AND - there is no gross plastic that can leech into your coffee. If you buy their filters it works best and takes out all the grit. I'm a big coffee drinker and no coffee maker comes close. Hooked for life on this.

One thing to note is that Chemex sells a version without a handle but instead has two wood pieces on the narrow part of the neck that is tied together by a string of leather. That wood and leather was on my original chemex and the wood gets discolored and worn...so does the leather. So this one I bought has a glass handle instead.

"Works great, sturdy","5,0 de 5 estrellas","It won't break if you don't break it, duh.

I have several of these, and yes I broke my 8-cup, my fault, so I bought this one. I mean, it's glass. Glass can break. Still, over the years I've bumped it into things, set it down too hard, and it held up fine.

The hand blown series is awesome looking, but for every day use, I go with the handle version. I find that this 8-cup size is good for 2 - 4 people. Typically I do about 50 grams coffee, and end up with 28-ish ounces of coffee. That's a bigger cup for me, and a smaller cup for my GF. If you like bigger ""American"" sized cups, keep in mind that this would max out at 3 16-ounce cups.

Great way to make coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I drink a lot of coffee everyday and really enjoy the process of making the coffee. Prior to getting the Chemex I used a Bodum french press every day. I loved my french presses, but I managed to shatter two glass ones, and most recently my plastic one developed a bunch of cracks, so I thought it was time to try something new. The Chemex is just as likely to fall victim to me being a klutz, but I still wanted to give it a try, especially because coffee snobs often say that it makes the best cup of coffee.

The device it self is very nice looking and feels good in the hand. The box includes the Chemex and a very small instruction sheet. I would recommend going to youtube and watching some videos on how to brew with the Chemex because there are a multitude of ways that people like to do it. I've only used it twice so far, but I have to say that it makes really delicious coffee. I don't usually care for drip style coffee makers because I think that the flavor is not a bold as you get from a french press, but the Chemex delivers the same amount of flavor that my french presses did. The upside to the Chemex is that you don't have the sediment in the coffee like you get with a french press. I didn't think the sediment bothered me for the past 6 years that I have been using a french press, but now that I have used the Chemex I realize that I was missing out.

The downside of the Chemex is that it is definitely more labor intensive than a french press, and certainly more so than a drip coffee maker. It requires attention during the brewing process, you have to continue to pour water on the grounds until you have brewed the desired amount of coffee. I don't mind doing this, but I could see it being a problem if you had to hurry out your door every morning. The clean up process is nice and easy, just trash the filter and rinse out the Chemex, which is quicker than having to wash out a french press.

Overall, I am loving the Chemex after the first couple of uses. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a really good cup of coffee and also enjoys being a part of the brewing process.",Ryan Brady,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de febrero de 2012
The Best Coffee Maker Makes the Best Coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I grew up in a house where my parents had used a Chemex coffee maker since 1955. So when my wife moved to 'deplasticise' our kitchen some 8 years ago, we too became avid Chemex users. The simple process produces a clean taste that leaves the 'fancy' machines way behind and with Chemex one never has to worry about contamination from the PET plastics or potentially dirty tubes that you often find in other coffee makers. We chose the Chemex version with a handle due to its convenience, but both the wooden collar and handled versions are icons of style and practicality. However, when I inadvertently broke our Chemex last year we learned that the design to the new models has been ever so slightly changed with a re-shaping of the pour spout. I assume this was done because, with the old design, the wet filter would sometimes block the air gap provided by the pour spout, with a resulting 'burp' as the urn tries to breathe. This would result in a small amount of hot moisture 'spitting' from the spout. Annoying but not tragic, and it was always possible to re-seat the filter so that there would be no spitting. The new design appears to have a deeper spout, making it less likely that the filter will block it and thus the 'spitting' has been remedied. However, another problem has been created as it is almost impossible to pour a full urn without spillage. If one pours too quickly, the coffee surges past the cup. Too slowly and it runs down the side of the urn and spills on the table. There is a 'Goldilocks' angle with no spillage that is possible to achieve, but honestly, I only succeed in getting it right perhaps 10% of the time (and I drink a lot of coffee). Don't get me wrong - I won't be changing my Chemex - the coffee is too good. But I think that the design change has only traded one problem for another. Perhaps it is possible to design a better spout or perhaps there is an option of building ridges into the filter nest to allow the urn to breathe elsewhere.",Kindle Customer,Revisado en Reino Unido el 2 de mayo de 2018

"IF YOU DON'T LOVE COFFEE, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE","5,0 de 5 estrellas","You can make it any way you want and drink it out of anything you find. So what?

On the other hand, if you do love it, then the time and effort it takes to brew a pot in a CHEMEX is well worth it. There's really no better way to do it. Matter of fact, trying to remember why I bought the CHEMEX, I recollect it was when, a month or so ago I was watching the AMERICAN TASTE KITCHEN on PBS, and Mr. Bow-Tie Guy -- commenting on the afternoon's test of coffee-makers -- confessed that he had a number of old electrics downstairs (in his basement, apparently) because over time he'd relegated them to oblivion. They were never able, quite, to give him the great cup of coffee he wanted and expected. And it came to him (that very afternoon) that the reason they didn't deliver the goods was simply because they couldn't heat the water hot enough. However, he was now able to offer to the world one electrically-powered device, in parts, that could when bolted together, make a good, strong cup of hot coffee. Of course, it looked like something out of STARSHIP GALACTICA and cost nearly a couple of hundred bucks!

Well, the boiling water thing. Yes, that sounded about right to me. I've got an old Mr. Coffee pot on the back shelf that just doesn't quite cut it. Never did, really, but it was earnest, dependable and kept the coffee hot. Too hot, (hot on the plate, that is) for too long. Hate burnt coffee. (But over Time my soul had fallen into such a state of corruption that I'd begun to defile my coffee with [ugh!] flavors. And not just flavors,but artificial flavors based on artificial milk. What further Hell awaited me?) There's an old Krupps machine resting beside Mr. Coffee that does heat the water to nearly the right degree, but by the time the coffee falls into the insulated carafe, its only a little more than warm and... Eventually... Then there's my old CorningWare Perk. I scarcely use it at all any more unless I'm on a nostalgia jag. I mean, talk about the 50s, it makes the best and strongest Wisconsin family farm brew ever! But who lives that way anymore? Or eats those kinds of heavy, breakfasts.

Anyway, as I was listening to thin, happy Mr. Bow Tie, it dawned on me that I had a big stainless steel kettle I practically never used; a Michael Graves thing with a penetrating whistle and a steamm-driven whirligig on the spout. Bought it for looks, but it sure works! So the lightbulb went on over my head and I got on the laptop and ordered a new CHEMEX from Amazon.com. The seller sent it FED-EX, so it took forever because they didn't deliver it to my apartment but pretended to, and finally just dumped it at their warehouse on the far West end of town. But, hey! It was worth the search. Once I got the pot and the filters home, filled the pot and brought it to a boil, all existence fell into place. Rapidly boiling water: It makes the difference.

Believe me, I hadn't owned one of those pots for over fifty years, but I remembered how I loved it in student days, as I poured, then drank my first cup. I've read what some of you've written. Stuff about being too busy. About it taking too long. What IS that? That mind-set? Cliff Notes mentality, isn't it? What advantage is there to having one's tastes abreviated, simplified? That's all the automatic brewers do. Who would read a Reader's Digest version of Proust's SEARCH FOR A LONG DEAD PAST? One might as well addict oneself to Instant CHOCK-FULL-O-NUTS.

"You won’t be disappointed, 3-cup or 5-cup is personal preference","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have the 5-cup wooden handle but only I drink coffee at home, so I finally succumbed and bought the 3-cup glass handle. If you are certain it’s just for yourself and you drink 1-2 full cups per sitting, be bold and get the 3-cup. The 5-cup looks nicer yes, but it has a broader base and as a result, I find that the coffee cools too quickly during the brewing process if you are only making a 1-person portion. Or maybe invest in a chemex cosy. I prefer the glass handle to the wooden collar as you don’t have to keep removing it and putting it back on for cleaning. But the wooden collar is prettier. My major concern with the 3-cup is in the bloom. I find that the coffee grounds don’t bloom as much, maybe because the funnel is so much steeper. But the outcome is still a really good cup of coffee so it depends on how much you value this point.",Adele Ng,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de septiembre de 2019

Love it!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this thing as it brews great coffee. The issues are that it's very hands-on, it requires a lot of additional things, and this particular one feels very thin and breakable.

Of course, you know you are going to be hands on with this thing, so no big deal. You should be expecting this. The coffee it makes is worth it.

The additional things add up in price very quickly. The filters are pretty expensive (though you might like using a reusable cloth filter and some people swear by them), you need an accurate kitchen scale, a timer (you probably have one on your smart phone), you will probably want a burr grinder to ensure your beans are fresh and evenly ground, and you should have a gooseneck kettle for proper pouring (I recommend the Benavita). These things can get costly fast if you are getting decent quality items.

The warmth I rated as a 3 out of 5 because it's thin glass and cools relatively quickly. Then again, you can always microwave the coffee to revive it. And if microwaving coffee makes you cringe, brew some coffee and then reheat it in a bunch of different ways. You won't be able to tell much difference and you might like the microwave the best when it comes to taste. Just try it.

Overall, I love this thing a lot and it's a nice little ritual every morning to get the day going. Might not be for everyone though.",Some random,Revisado en Canadá el 3 de marzo de 2021

It's very attractive and easy to use,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","It's very attractive and easy to use, but the glass is surprisingly fragile. It even had a crack in the top upon arrival despite there being no damage to the product box or the shipping box. The product box isn't protective enough. I've been handling it carefully, and the crack hasn't grown or seemed to effect the use of it. I would have expected something sturdier for the cost though.

I bought the official Chemex filters, and they are nice but a little too big for this 3-cup size and bunch up a little. The creases don't seem to effect the coffee brewing though, and I've really enjoyed the coffee I've made it in. I just make one nice big cup for myself in the morning.

Chemex says one cup equals 5 ounces, so I thought this would only fit 15 ounces. You could actually make a little more in it than that. Probably more like 20 ounces.

I like the handle, and I enjoy the process of making pour over coffee. I also really like that this is all glass, since I was worrying about the plastics in my drip coffee maker.

Best coffee ever - use it every single morning!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this 10-cup glass handled Chemex coffee maker + pre-folder filters about 5 months ago, and I have been using it every single day since I bought it. It makes the most delicious coffee I have ever had. There is no bitterness, it is smooth and rich. I have read in several articles that the oils that are actually bad for you stay in this filter, so only the good stuff gets into your cup.

My advice to anyone thinking about buying a Chemex to make their daily coffee is this: it takes a little longer to make your coffee, and the process may initially seem *slightly* complicated if you are used to a press & brew machine, so consider that before buying it and being annoyed.

I did quite a bit of research into different brewing methods, and came up with this one, which takes about 18 minutes from start to finish:

1. Put filter into Chemex, 3 fold side toward the spout.
2. Boil some water separately for warming the Chemex & wetting the filter.
3. Measure out 5 oz water per heaping tablespoon of medium ground coffee, boil.
4. When the ""warming"" water is hot, pour over filter. Then pour it out.
5. Add coffee, create a divet in the center of the coffee.
6. When the measured water boils, turn it off and wait about 30 seconds for it to stop boiling. (Chemex says water should be about 180 - 200 degrees in order for there to be no bitterness....)
7. Pour a little water into the center divet you created, allow the coffee to bloom.
8. Continue pouring water over the coffee - around the sides first, then center, until it reaches top of filter. Repeat as necessary.
9. Drink, enjoy.

Like I said, I do this every morning, making about 30oz / 6 heaping tablespoons / 4 cups of coffee. It takes me anywhere from 15 - 18 minutes. It has become a ritual I enjoy, especially since the coffee taste is so incredibly satisfying.",Dilara,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de enero de 2015

It's made of glass so shattering isn't totally unexpected, but it can be a bit startling in the morning before I've had my coffee.

I use the Chemex FS-100 Coffee Filters with 100-Chemex Bonded Filter Squares with my chemex.

An elegant and classic design with functionality.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The CHEMEX coffeemaker is one of the best filter coffee makers around.
It's remarkably easy to use and the design of the coffeemaker is very elegant and timeless.
Coupled with the coffee filters by CHEMEX, it produces a consistent and aromatic cup of coffee every single time.

The major downsides to the CHEMEX coffeemaker is that it is sometimes hard to clean without removing the bamboo holder.
Normally a rinse with hot water will suffice, but it's not as easy as just throwing it into the dishwasher.
Putting the bamboo holder with the leather strings might be the most challenging part of them all.

Although it has some shortcomings, it does not really hinder the experience of manually brewing excellent coffee.

Smooth Coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Been searching quite a while for a good cup of coffee at home. I was getting tired of trying percolators and automatic drip only to get inconsistent or not-so-good results. Recently I purchased a larger french press, an aeropress and this Chemex maker (8 cup, glass handle).

I don't like the coffee from the french press. Always gritty and inconsistent. Definitely tasteful but some of that taste is bitterness or off-tastes that made a cup less than enjoyable.

My Aeropress has been outstanding. It makes a fine single cup (or maybe 2 cups) of coffee but, even though I measure and monitor I don't seem to make consistently good coffee. It is always really good but the strength and the flavors seem to change from cup to cup. It isn't difficult to make a cup that is a little bitter. I tried both paper and metal filters. When I want a quick cup of coffee I wouldn't hesitate to use the Aeropress. Have to admit, it is fun!

Finally the Chemex. I've just had it two days and have been through maybe 10 cups of coffee. As with the Aeropress I measure grounds by weight and I'm pretty precise with the amount of water. I have a kettle where I set the temperature so I'm sure I'm using water right at 200 degrees F. I'm using the bonded, unbleached, square chemex filters. What I have found so far was a tasty cup of coffee with no bitterness. I can adjust the strength by the ratio of water to grounds (currently 20 oz water and 36 grams of medium-coarse coffee). I have been mostly following the little instruction guide that comes with the beaker.

The Chemex will be my daily go-to coffee maker for a while. I may try something different down the road but so far this is the cup of coffee I have been looking for. I'm having fun trying local roasts as well as some roasts from Whole Foods (try the Haitian coffees - Cafe Kreyol). Definitely happy with the Chemex purchase.",Kevin der Kinderen,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de diciembre de 2013
"FYI - only about 6 cups by standard cup measure, but it's plastic - free!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","When I first saw the box I was surprised at the small size of the 10 cup Chemex. We had a Chemex when I was young and I remembered it being bigger than this. I tried making 8 cups of coffee, but all the water didn't fit. I think they mean 10 cups of 5 oz. each, not our usual 10 cups of 8 oz. each. In that case, it makes a little more than 6 cups of coffee. When looking online for a larger size, I came across the 13 cup hand blown Chemex with the notation that this was what you would have had if you had a Chemex in the 70s, so I am thinking that what we had was the 13 cup.

That caveat aside, the Chemex makes great coffee. While it is more hands-on than my old electric coffeemaker, given my goal of great cup of coffee without any plastic, I am without many options. I am not a huge fanatic about the whole brewing process because I like to have a cup of coffee with minimal effort in the morning, so I wet the filter with boiling water the night before and later in the evening measure the coffee and water also. (I bought the Precise electric kettle because it is literally the only one I could find with no plastic, and it has so far been great for heating the water quickly.) In the morning, I just turn on the electric kettle and follow the Chemex pouring instructions, which is about all I am capable of before my coffee anyway. I bought the handle model instead of the leather/wood option so that I can just put it in the dishwasher. I have been very happy with that also.",Sande,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de febrero de 2013
Great cup of coffee and easy to clean!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My search for the perfect coffee maker is finally over. I have tried your traditional drip coffee makers as well as French Press and the Chemex blows them out of the water. I needed a coffee maker that made a good cup of coffee but was also easy to clean. With your traditional drip coffee machine you may have the convenience of an automatic brewer but you eventually have to clean it. If you live an area with hard water your coffee machine, no matter how fancy, will eventually be thrown in the trash due to calcium build up. Even if you follow the care instructions and clean with vinegar regularly, you cannot clean all parts of the machine without taking it apart so your coffee will eventually take longer and longer to brew and will not taste nearly as good as it did the first day.

With a French Press you get a good cup of coffee and are able to clean it properly but it is a pain to keep clean. After a while, I would just avoid using it so I didn't have to spend the time rinsing and washing all the parts. I also did not appreciate the fine grounds in my cup of coffee.

With the Chemex, it took me a few days to figure out how to brew the perfect cup of coffee. I used the Chemex brand circle filters. The instructions that came with it are a bit vague so my first cup of coffee was a little weak. I did some internet research to figure out the best way to brew with the Chemex and now my coffee tastes much better. After wetting the grounds and allowing them to ""bloom"" you will need to stir them with a spoon to ensure all grounds are evenly brewed. Then fill with more water, stir, and allow at least half of that water to pass through the filter before adding more water. Each time you add water, you should stir the grounds.

My only complaint is that the glass does not hold in heat well so the coffee gets lukewarm between cups. You can put it on the stove to reheat it if you have a glass top electric stove. I do not have the glass lid but I have read in the reviews you do not need it if you simply keep the filter with grounds in the top between cups to act as a lid.

As far as cleaning it, after I am done I pour the rest of the coffee out and rinse it with water and a small drop of dish soap. I swish the soapy water around, pour, rinse and repeat. It takes less than a minute. For the ease of cleaning alone, I love this thing. I bought the scrubber brush but still have not used it. Once a month I will rinse with vinegar to prevent hard water build up.",dlivtx,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de enero de 2015

Der Kaffee schmeckt sehr gut, obwohl ich nicht weiß, was alles eingebildet ist, oder ob ich den Kaffee in einer Blindverkostung herausschmecken würde. Die Karaffe kann gut auf einem Teelicht warm gehalten werden und kann, natürlich ohne den abnehmbaren Holzrand, in die Spülmaschine. Die Handhabung beim Eingießen ist bei voller Karaffe etwas umständlich, was der Optik geschuldet ist. Zusammen mit dem doch recht hohen Preis ziehe ich daher einen Punkt ab.

Replacement Chemex,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought an 8 cup Chemex in Sept. 2021 to replace a 3-4 year old 6-cup that we broke in the sink. This is our third or fourth Chemex and our first 8-cup. Couldn’t remember which model we had until we got the larger one and our 1.2 L kettle didn’t fill it as far.

The new 8-cup glass isn’t obviously thinner, but it certainly doesn’t seem thicker than our previous 6 -cup models. The pouring spout seems more squared off and pours significantly better than the old pot that used to spill when it was full. I have also noticed that the filter seems to clog the spout a little a little easier as I think it’s a little wider than the old spout and so has a larger distance to bridge.

We also just purchased a Capresso burr grinder and replaced the blade grinder we’d been using for years. I used to pulse and shake the blade grinder. I think the burr does seem to yield a bit better coffee, maybe less bitter, and maybe I’m using a little less than before. It takes a little longer to filter.

We use a 1.2 L curved spout pour over kettle on an induction stove and it boils so fast that you have to watch it or else it boils over, especially if you leave the cover on. It basically holds 1000 mL (1.2L if filled to the brim, which will definitely boil over). I’m using about 55g to 1L and the 8-cup is filled about 3/4 full. It’s the same amount we made in the 6-cup, but the six cup would be filled right to the filter. I tried 65g initially and felt it was too strong for my taste. May try 60g soon. Grind is set around 14 of 16 and at the top end of the range suggested by Capresso. Takes around 5-7 minutes. I’ll leave the kettle on low to keep it from getting too cool between pours. As soon as it’s ready we pour it into a Yeti thermos which keeps it hot between cups.

It basically makes 4 regular/medium size (8-Oz) mugs of coffee. You could probably get 6 mugs if you fill the 8-cup maker all the way.",Bruce G. Eaton,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de septiembre de 2021

"Love Chemex, but not sure who to be disappointed with : (","1,0 de 5 estrellas","First and foremost, I highly recommend a Chemex and love the product and coffee it produces. However, I would suggest buying directly from Chemex, or locally so you know what you are getting.

I received a broken 8 cup classic with handle and promptly ordered a replacement. The first one and the second are vastly different. The first one was a gift, so I am not sure who fulfilled the order, but the second one came from Barista Labs (which is an authorized seller, per the Chemex web site). However, the second Chemex felt much cheaper than the first one I received.

Here are the difference:
First unit had an 'X' molded into the bottom, the second unit had a 'Chemex' stamp.

First unit was much heavier than the second (even broken and missing the top portion it weighed more than the second unit (see photos) 574 grams vs 500 gram.

First unit had a seem running from the spout to the handle, the second unit appears seemless. Looking at photos on the chemex web site, they all show a seem.

Overall the first unit seemed to be better made than the second, even though it was broken (who knows what happened in transit). The second unit seems very light and fragile. Not sure if I should just send it back or test my luck with it. I have used it and it makes a great cup just like other chemex I have used.

Terrible Coffee,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I am sorry I ordered this coffee maker. I have tried it for a few days and I cannot drink the coffee. All I taste is the paper filter. I tried the boiling water first, as recommended, to wash the filter, but it makes no difference. I was attracted to this maker because I used to make German Kaffee with the Melita filters , or some other paper or bamboo filters, and I thought that produced best coffee I had ever had. Then, for convenience, I started using automatic coffeemaker with fairly good results until it stopped working. So I thought I would go back to the pour over method with more up-to-date makers.As I said, I will have to find another way of making coffee because I consider coffee something to be enjoyed, not something you have to work at to get it down. Another issue is the very large filters. I like to recycle coffee grounds and with the old filters, it was easy to do, but with the wastefully huge and expensive Chemex filters, it is difficult to get the grounds out and the filters are too big to recycle, unless you have a sophisticated recycling system. The old organic filters I can just let rot under some shrubs without seeing them, or save the grounds for other purposes and not use the paper filter. Not so with Chemex.

The poor quality glass utilized in the manufacturing of these carafes can not tolerate the daily and repeated hot water contact.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","The design and manufacture of these Chemex 10 cup carafes is substandard and of inferior quality.

I did not write a product review after the first carafe cracked and broke off because I was not certain of the cause. Now I am certain that the breakage was/is not due to rough handling or ""accidents"". This is a poor product made from inferior material and with inferior workmanship.

One size does NOT fit all.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I previously purchased a six-cup Chemex. I typically try to brew around 30 ounces of liquid net, so I need over 70 grams of coffee to brew at my desired ratio. The problem I was running into was, by the time you bloom 70 grams of grounds, there is very little room in the top filter section to add more water. In my six-cup, I had difficulty creating consistent extractions which didn't choke, even with my quality flat burr grinder. I ordered the 10-cup Chemex assuming the top portion would be larger and would be able to accommodate more grounds and water, but the filter section seems to be the exact same size as the 6-cup. Maybe there's something I'm missing, but I don't understand why the top of the 10-cup isn't larger to hold more ground coffee / water.

Long story short, I'll be returning the 10-cup. I've really enjoyed the coffee from my 6-cup, but I was hoping to brew larger batches at a time.

I am sending you pictures of the 2nd Chemex 10 cup that has shattered in less than one month from just tipping over non-violently on a relatively soft counter top. This time as it hit, and I tried to stop its fall, it already shattered into jagged edges and slivers that lacerated my hand and fingers. Each time this took me over an hour to try and get all the tiny slivers and flakes of extremely sharp shattered glass. I owned a Chemex in the 70's and had it for decades and survived a number of much more significant events than this. I realize that times are such, but perhaps you should consider altering this product into a thicker pyrex version, and offer as an option at least... there remains no better way to make coffee that I know of. But this product may be dangerous... and more significantly so in a different environs with children. I live alone, and still from such a minor event I am injured, and pray there is no sliver in my palm to dig out later on when the numbness goes away.

We were shocked because our 6 cup chemex is definitely stronger than this. Reading the other reviews, it seems as though it was redesigned to be lighter, but much more fragile. We contacted the Chemex customer service, who denied responsibility and were unwilling to help saying there is no warranty.

Chemix seemed to be a great choice. However, the amount of money you pay, and in less than 3 weeks of regular use, my Chemix began to fall apart. The wood piece around the neck which are either glued or held together, and which you use to hold the carafe, became separated and started moving around. The leather band made to hold it together when the wood pieces were glued, stopped holding the pieces in place. Not only does my pretty Chemix now look bad, it is hard to use. Also, the filter situation is slightly complicated and can get expensive over time.",Mara Bloom,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de marzo de 2021
MANUFACTURING DEFECT!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I question if this product was sitting on a shelf for 10 years, or if Chemex even manufactured it according to license.

This is now the SECOND Chemex I have bought through Amazon, and the second product to shatter for no explicable reasons whatsoever.

I am an expert coffee brewer, who brews to specification according to the official Chemex website. I do not put my device in the dishwasher, drop it, nick it, or anything. With no force beyond how someone would touch a baby or dog, this Chemex shattered in the sink barely touching a surface. No product made to specification should behave with such a delicate touch. It is simply unusable if that is the case.

I love the brewing method but the quality should be 0, let alone 1, and frankly I urge the seller to contact me because this is frankly the most defective product I have ever bought in my life. Very disappointed, betrayed by Chemed, and simply angry!",John Wilson,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de julio de 2020
Doesn’t hold up well,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I was making coffee like every morning for the past month with this Chemex. Coffee tasted great, low effort to clean, life was perfect. Today, I go to make my perfect cup for my wife and I. Ground up my beans, heated up my water, and after waiting for the water to get to that perfect 200 degree temp, I go to pour it in. Next thing that happens is I hear a loud popping sound. I notice the bottom of the chemex has a line going up and the bottom part completely busted out.

Sadly I’m past my refund date and from what I’ve read about chemex and their warranty, I won’t get one since I purchased it on Amazon. I’m out 47 bucks so just be wary when selecting a coffee maker.",Mexz,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de septiembre de 2020
It’ll be back to the French Press for me!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I never write reviews, but was so disappointed with this, I just have to. I was excited about this product due to the way it looks. For me though, this ended up a classic case of don’t judge a book by it’s cover. I actually just used it for the first time and hated it. It was hard to clean due to the fact that the opening isn’t big enough to get your hand through. I could NOT figure out how to fold the filter for the life of me (I looked for an instructional video, but couldn’t find one for the type I bought) and apparently I am not the only one who has this problem. The coffee tastes SO weak it was like drinking water AND (lastly), it did not retain ANY heat. Super bummed. I’ll be going back to my $20 French Press for sure.",Phoenix Giffen,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de junio de 2019
Careful: Breakable,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","What I love about this carafe is it does the job, and is aesthetically attractive. I like the handle a lot. I use a stainless steel reusable filter with it, Which is environmentally friendly and let’s some of the natural oils of the coffee into the carafe which makes the coffee richer. Two things I don’t love our that it breaks easily and dishwasher sediment sticks to the inside. Three of mine have broken and the sides of the wall are about as thin as a postcard. I am quite careful with it. Product development should double the thickness of the walls. I honestly don’t have anything else in my kitchen – tools, classes or bowls – that I break. This is the only one. As for the sediment issue, I simply stick a long brush down and re-clean the carafe when it happens. But again no either glass or tool in my kitchen arsenal has this problem.",Scott Watenpaugh,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de abril de 2018
"Functional Retro design, Great coffee, Fun brew but poor glass quality!","1,0 de 5 estrellas","Love the design. Love the coffee made with it. Hate the fragile glass as this one lasted less than a year! This is our third (yes, 3) Chemex and third to crack. First one cracked during cleaning, second one cracked on stove-top while keeping coffee warmed (over low heat on Lodge trivet) and this one cracked after rinse and a tap against mug in drip-dry rack. We use a stainless steel filter and prefer over Chemex filters (had hard time finding filters few years back, went with sieve; Kone by Coava, outstanding). Also, use Hario V60 Buono Coffee Drip Kettle as we love this style coffee. So, only options are, order new hand-blown and hope it is better, order another ""classic"" with hope for longer use, find old Pyrex Chemex or go another direction with drip brewing. Bingo...I put Kone in a Norpro stainless steel canning funnel on top of a two-quart canning jar. Works for now and we live in the Ozarks of MO so this fix doesn't raise one eyebrow. Will continue to look for a better way....",Flyboy7905,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de marzo de 2015
Would give zero stars if possible,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This was a huge disappointment. I spent hours researching the most eco friendly LARGE coffee carafe. The reason I picked this one was because it advertised 10 cups and others were less. This is a blatant lie. I measured it out and it only holds 5 cups. Maybe it would be 10 cups if you filled it up to the top and over the filter, which is not a reasonable thing to do. Crazy that a company can get away with such a misrepresentation of their product. Also, the glass feels much flimsier than I would hope for that price. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed. I was so excited for this product and to use it for years to come, but now must go back to the drawing board and continue researching for something bigger. I can’t speak to how well it works (or doesn’t) because I will not be keeping it.",Sarah Endsley,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de agosto de 2018
Can't recommend this product at all,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","The idea of the Chemex is very appealing, but it is so delicate it isn't worth bothering with! Mine BROKE THE VERY FIRST TIME I USED IT!!!! I touched the lip of the Chemex with the pot of hot water I was pouring and a piece broke off. No, I didn't bang it. How is this thing going to give years of use if it can't stand a bump? The worst part is, the vendor, BetterProductsOnline, sells the product without warning about its delicate nature, and now is ignoring my request to return it. This is the first and last time I buy anything from them.

Update: BetterProductsOnline refused to refund my money, but arranged for the manufacturer to replace my Chemex with a new one. I'll give them credit for doing that. However, the basic problem still stands - the product is too delicate for normal handling. I rarely use it because of its fragility, so in that sense I'm still out the purchase cost. Bottomline, the Chemex is not worth buying unless you are ok with its delicate nature. Oh, it's difficult to clean, too. Just look at the shape and you will see why.",A.

Is this really top quality Chemex?,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased the 3 cup because I thought the 6 cup was too large...it turns out I like the 6 cup better than the 3 cup for a few reasons. Reason 1) the glass on the 3 cup has bubbles and there are obvious seams in the glass from the mold on both the front and the back (the 6 cup does not have this 2) To brew, you have to pour water into the filter very slowly as it fills up too quickly, given it is so small in the filter area 3) The glass seems so fragile and the handle very delicate and I worry it could end up coming apart in my hand due to what appears to be inferior manufacturing. I do not recommend the 3 cup",D. I.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de octubre de 2019

However, Amazon's packaging did not account for the fact that this product is made of glass: The Chemex arrived completely broken, with the top half shattered into a million pieces.

So much for the chemists grade glass. I notified Chemex of the problem and that it was a recent purchase and had only been used a few times. Their response was that I could purchase a ""Factory Second"" which would have cosmetic problems for $10 plus the cost of shipping. I was honestly floored that they wouldn't stand behind their product and politely requested a new one. They refused.

but it looks like the wooden collar they use on the 10-cup model ...,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","As soon as a received this product I noticed that the 2-piece wood collar/handle did not not fit together on the back side and had large gaps between the wood and the glass. After only a few uses this caused the wood to break and crack in several spots from the heat of the water and stress of picking it up by the handle. This could be a manufacturing defect, but it looks like the wooden collar they use on the 10-cup model is not made for it, but possibly the same size they use on the 6 or 8 cup model, allowing them to cut corners in production. Considering this product is so expensive, I was very disappointed. Save yourself some money and get one of the off brands.",covfefe_connoisseur,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de octubre de 2017
Not the same product as the original,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this new coffeemaker to replace one I have had over two years that broke. The new Chemex is very fragile in comparison to the older version. The glass is much thinner. I think that it would be very susceptible to chipping and cracking based on it's paper thinness alone. For nearly $50, I expect something that matches the original heftiness and durability similar to the one I originally purchased.",StayInformed,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de diciembre de 2019
COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","The product looks genuine at first glance. The packaging and instruction leaflet are really well made, but the quality of the glass gives it away.

I never used anything else than a soft brush or the dishwasher to clean it. The second picture shows an air bubble in the glass.

Chemex Using Substandard/Less Glass now,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","We have an 8 cup Chemex and it is by far the most amazing coffee you can make, bar none. We figured after a few years it would be good to add a 10 cup but as many have mentioned, they are indeed using cheaper and thinner glass. The 10 cup, while dimensionally larger weighs 1.9oz less than the smaller 8 cup. It’s too bad that to increase profits they are sacrificing quality.

DIFFICULT TO HANDLE AND TO CLEAN,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I am a Brazilian coffee lover! I have tested so many different kinds of coffeemakers , filters, coffee grounds, grinders, , you name it - even a digital kettle for the very right temperature! I had to try Chemex, and as I first spotted it, for its handsomeness only. I wasn't wrong - it is very handsome and coffee can be tasteful, but thats all. First contra: it is very difficult to handle as you have to hold on the wooden collar, which is a bit wobbly, and we are talking about a reasonably heavy hot bottle. Once you pour it, you need to be careful with the hot glass not touching you arm, which is a disaster waiting to happen. More: you cannot keep the coffee warm, unless you have an extra electric device or , if you are old school, keep in in bain marie, but either way, bear in mind there is no lid, so even if you keep it warm for half an hour for a second cup, it is going to be a different coffee due to condensation, unless you buy a lid... Not done yet: cleaning is a nightmare! You need to remove the collar, if you care about not having mould on it, and good luck on reaching the bottom of the Chemex. Now , the fact that it can break so easily will go without saying. I see a lot of problems on the Chemex and will soon donate it",Matthew David Smith,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de mayo de 2023
"Wow, now I'm brewing tea!!","2,0 de 5 estrellas","Well, not what I expected after reading the glowing 5 star reviews on here!! I would recommend to anyone thinking about purchase to question how strong they like their coffee. Apparently I like coffee stronger than most (at least the 5 star reviewers on here).

This thing basically tastes like I'm brewing tea!! Looks like it also!

The Chemex filter claims to be 20 to 30% thicker than a conventional filter to extract the bitterness. The problem is it extracts more than bitterness IMO.

Personally I have never had any grounds or residue in my coffee while using my Cuisinart auto drip maker with Melita filters.

Any bitterness in my coffee I have recently taken care of by purchasing a Bodum conical burr grinder (fantastic move) to replace my blade grinder. I had no idea how much impact that would have on flavor, or I would have done it long ago. Very dramatic!!

So, after reading tons of reviews talking about how great the coffee is from this device, and what a huge difference it makes. I wanted to check it out. I consider myself a heavy coffee drinker, and fairly picky about quality and taste. I then debated the reality of being locked into buying special filters that cost 3 to 4 times as much as conventional filters, and need to be ordered online. The claims of fantastic coffee outweighed the filter issue. So, I decide to purchase!

I follow the instructions to the letter. The coffee comes out weak and fairly lame. Surprised at my results, I go online and research...youtube here we go. Lots of guys in funny hats on there describing and showing how to ""properly brew"" using this device. I weigh and measure the coffee on my kitchen digital food scale (oh you didn't know you needed that??). Luckily I already owned one. Heated my water properly. I originally thought I could use the instant hot in my kitchen, which would have been awfully convenient (not quite hot enough). Then tare my scale and weigh the water being passed through the filter. I mean, there are guides to how many grams of water for how many seconds of brew....I'll bite...I followed them all.

Well, I have to say....this thing took my reasonably fresh roasted (about 2 weeks ""old"") beautiful dark roast coffee and turned it into tea. Very weak for my taste.

I have attempted to change the ratios of water to coffee to alleviate the problem. One of the claims is that you can go strong because the filter will take care of any bitterness. (again, I don't experience any bitterness with my regular brewing....so..)

The recommended ratio is 40-42 grams of coffee to 700 grams of water. I went ahead and brewed 52 grams of coffee to 650 grams of water. This change definitely made a better cup of coffee....but still not as outstanding as others have stated. In fact pretty close to my ""regular"" cup. Which doesn't take nearly the effort...the difference in taste is minimal.

I would recommend that anyone who is experiencing bitter coffee ensure that their drip maker is top notch. Cone, not flat...then spend your money on a quality conical burr grinder. Not this thing!! I know that's more of an investment...but it's worth it.

I am going to continue to ""play"" with the ratios of coffee to water...after all I have 95 remaining filters to go through. I will update this review if I find any ratios that work better. But I highly doubt I will replace the filters when they are gone. I'll just suck up the 40 bucks I spent on the carafe.

If you are into scientific experiments, and weak over filtered coffee. Then by all means order this thing. Otherwise save your money to invest in a quality grinder.

Update: I have now played with the ratios and have found that 52 grams of coffee to 550 grams of water. Now that's a strong cup of coffee!! French press style with absolutely no grounds or sediment of any kind. Still not recommending it though. All this weighing of my coffee has me weighing my ""normal"" brewing method. I put 24 grams of coffee through my maker for ""6 cups"" (2.5 mugs). I already go through a pound of fresh beans a week...not looking to double that.

Chemex 8 cup coffee maker poorly engineered.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","For over 6 months my wife and I were in pursuit of a non-toxic, lead free, and BPA free coffee maker. Ordered the Chemex 8 cup unit and waited anxiously for the arrival of our long sought after coffee maker. The day it arrived was filled with anticipation only to discover Chemex couldn't include 1 or 2 coffee filters to hold us over till the filter order arrived. Then next day it occurred to me that the unit lacked a top. If it were to be placed on a table or in the refrigerator without a top, the coffee would soon cool down and the flavor lost. Checking the box for filters or a top was an effort in vain. I thought to call Chemex and ask why these items were not included or at least mentioned in the advertisement, especially since the recommendations stated the unit could be put in the refrigerator till the next days use. I was told by customer service Chemex, that they would inform the necessary people of the suggestion of filters being included in the packaging. I was further told that I could cover the unit with something to keep the coffee in the refrigerator from loosing its flavor and absorbing the smells that might be inside the refrigerator. What? What could be used to cover the unit? Saran Wrap? Why? Why is the cover/top not an integral part of the machine? Do you buy a new car and then have to buy the fuel injection parts as a necessary but optional necessity to drive down the road? I was told I could buy a cover/top for $8 plus shipping. Thanks, but no thanks, the unit will be returned to Amazon, who was guiltless in this fiasco. If I don't stand for something I will fall for anything. It is really too bad, we thought we found our destiny coffee maker.",Tom Dully,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de febrero de 2020
I don't like it....,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used the Chemex for about a week now and I really don't like it. I bought their filters and use them and I've followed the instructions and have altered the amount of coffee grounds I use but it still does not taste right! And it's not nearly hot enough.

I normally use a stainless steel French Press, but I had heard and read so many good things about Chemex I wanted to try it.. I just cannot seem to get it right though and I am so disappointed.

The coffee is warm, not hot and it's weak. The water doesn't stay with the grounds long enough to get a bold, rich flavor. I also think the paper filters cause it to have a weird flavor. I don't know what else it could be. I can use the same amount of grounds in the French Press and it tastes great but the Chemex tastes off to me.

I will say the Chemex is much easier to clean than the French Press. You just fold the used filter with the grounds inside and throw it away; rinse out the carafe and you're done. Maybe I will re-gift it to someone else who might appreciate it. For me, it just doesn't make as good of a cup of coffee as a French Press.",Chelle,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de octubre de 2018
Newer Isn’t Better,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Update: March 22, 2021, 7 months after we purchased, the glass broke. My husband lifted the carafe and bumped it against an open cabinet door. It was a very light tap, but the glass instantly broke into multiple pieces. I’d written to Chemex and they replied saying, “Chemex has in fact upgraded the glass used for these coffeemakers to a higher quality glass in order to provide a more durable product. It is a common misconception that thinner glass means cheaper product which is more prone to breakage. In this case, although the walls are slightly thinner, the higher quality of the glass is actually less-prone to breakage. This is because the walls have a more uniform thickness that allows for less tension in the glass and reduces risks for cracks.” Sorry kids. This is garbage.

Update: Purchased August 27, 2020 and the wood split in half twelve days later. I’m sorry to say that the quality of Chemex has dramatically changed.

We purchased our first Chemex in 2012. Unfortunately we’ve had to replace it. The newer Chemex is noticeably different in quality, especially the glass. It is much thinner than our original model. Big disappointment.",LLL,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de agosto de 2020
I loved my Chemex but they don't stand behind there product,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased my Chemex in Dec of 2019 and have been very pleased with it. Last week during making my morning coffee it began leaking. I noticed it leaking from the bottom, then was a bit shocked to find that there was a hole on the bottom. The Chemex doesn't leave the caddy, I don't use it on the stove and never have I put it in the dishwasher . The Chemex was not dropped. I believed there was a weak area in the glass that caused the hole. I contacted Chemex and they told me to take it back to the retailer. I informed them that retailer was an approved online retailer that Chemex stated in their return policy for RMA's. Then the response from Chemex was I caused Traumatic damage to the coffee maker and that it wont be acceptable for RMA. They further responded that they could give me a 10% discount on another Chemex.

No gradations,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Ok, you measure out your coffie by putting the scoopfulls into the filter. Then your pour the hot water into the filter, oops, how much water, how do you tell if it's enough or not enough? I know, you pour 5 oz. of water for every scoop of coffee, so you take your favorite cup, fill it full of water, pour the measured water into a measuring cup, note the oz. multiply that by the number of cups you want (don't forget to fudge the water for the amount absorbed by the grounds) and pour that into the beaker and make a mark on the side of the beaker with a magic marker and pour away. (Don't, and I mean don't scratch a line on the beaker, it's tempered glass and you will end up with a beaker full of hot coffee on the counter and floor when it breaks. Not if, but when) With a little trial and error you get it down pretty close to the mark, but oh oh 1) the magic marker mark comes off when washing by hand and by dishwasher and drat you've got a neighbor over and you want to make a cup for him/her, so you follow the steps above all over.
I have a little problem in ""bloomong"" the grounds, there ain't no way to do this without having some water come through and enter the beaker and it's a real PIA to have to stand there and watch water flow through the filter so you can pour more, about as much fun as watching paint dry.
When I was in high school chemistry class we had beakers that has etched gradation lines on our beakers, I know that was a 1/2 century +/-, mostly +++++ ago, but for $40-$50 bucks I expect more.

WARM & UNDER-EXTRACTED,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Wanted to love this so much, but it just didn't perform as advertised.
1) Coffee is always warm at most, no matter how hot I keep the water (even reheating it during pouring). The long pouring process causes the water to cool by the time I made a sufficient amount of cups.
2) The pouring takes a much longer process than I anticipated even after purchasing and trying a variety of filters
3) Coffee always comes out under-extracted
4) Tried different kinds of grinds - per instruction, and all other types, coffee still comes out under-extracted
5) ALL IN ALL.......Does not function as advertised. RETURNED.
*****TIP***Also, just a TIP - make sure you purchase from an authorized seller when placing in your cart.

Not Worth Your Time,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","My wife and I decided that it was time to upgrade from our trusty old Mr. Coffee, thinking that we would taste a big difference using the Chemex (such an appetizing name for a coffeemaker). I wanted to like this coffeemaker, I really did. Unfortunately, it just wasn't practical enough to keep and I returned it after a few uses.

It's a good-looking thing for sure, but that gimmicky leather-bound two-piece wooden MISTAKE that serves to prevent you from searing your fingertips off is a NIGHTMARE. It MUST come off before you wash (or rinse) the coffeemaker or the varnish vanishes, and untying and tying it back on again tightly enough is an exercise in patience and dexterity that no early-riser wants to wrestle with. It also took significantly longer to brew coffee, particularly if you follow the several OPTIONAL steps (we found that the coffee tasted no differently whether you followed them or not). Perhaps the biggest disappointment was that the coffee brewed with it tasted virtually identical to the coffee produced by our Mr. Coffee coffeemaker that we paid less than $20 for years ago.

Giving it two stars only because I dropped the slippery, awkwardly-shaped aberration in the metal sink and it suffered zero damage despite the hard hit.",R_P_M,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de mayo de 2017
Poor design for the 3 cup version.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I will stick with the 6 cup version. I love the clean cup of coffee, but this 3 cup version is too narrow on the top half so you have too keep pouring tiny amounts of water in about 5 times. I also ordered the Chemex filters; the only version available to fit the 3 cup comes in a large flat box. Where would I conveniently store this in my kitchen? It takes too much hassle for me to fold the filters, and it is difficult to remove a single one from the stack. I like the square folded filters, just grab one and open it. Also the 3 cup filters form an excessively long cone shape that hangs down halfway through the bottom part almost to the button of the vessel. I'll stick with my six cup wood collar until the collar wears out or the glass breaks. The 6 cup is hard to pour because the collar is too fat to hang on to easily with one hand (maybe if you have big hands it's no problem). As I said though I love the coffee it makes and am foregoing a french press for it.",Samantha,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de noviembre de 2016
Too fragile for the price,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Sadly, my experience with Chemex coffemakers is that they are just too fragile for me.

I was on my third Chemex (one with the wood handle and leather tie, and two with the glass handle), and broke it last night with a glancing tap of the faucet while washing it. And I am pretty careful to avoid hitting the pot with anything for exactly that reason. Part of it is that the 10-cup model is quite large, so trying to wash it and still keep it away from the faucet is difficult at best. But it's way too easy to break, in my experience.

Replaced it with a $20 Bodum pour-over. I don't know whether it'll be any more sturdy, but it's lower-profile, and if it does break, I can buy 3 of them for the price of one Chemex.

FWIW, if you have a deep sink, or a high faucet, you may not have problems. And it does make good coffee. So may work for others, but I'm done buying these.",Seeker,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de diciembre de 2017
Quality Concerns,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I was very excited to receive my Chemex for my birthday, only to find the glass quality is poor and the product packaging lacking. Maybe I've been spoiled by my recently broken Bodum french press which has been discontinued and which prompted the Chemex purchase, and my various Bodum glassware, but this product left me thinking it was a second. Visible uneven swirls in the glass throughout, prominent mold seams, and a general impression of lacking quality. We'll see how it performs, as this is the reason I purchased for it. Also worth mention that the box for it and the Chemex filters both appeared to have been opened and beat up despite the Amazon box being fine, and the Chemex itself was downright filthy and requiring a heavy cleaning uncommon for a new product (hard to clean too). So I attribute the product issues to Chemex, packaging and product cleanliness issues to Barista Lab.

And I'm pretty careful with things. This was a replacement from one I've had for years. I guess they decided to go with the whole making more money thing and use the hand blow glass ones to jack the price up to $100 and sell this cheap thing for $50. It's worth maybe $10 bucks.

But having made the mistake of buying this I'm of the opinion that it's all fetish bunkum. You don't just buy a pot. You get raped for fancy-scmansie paper rugs you have to artistically drape over the funnel. Then you have to ritualistically pour water over grounds in a not too fast and not to slow method that takes forever to get you 6-8 cups of brew. THEN you figure out that you need to keep the pot over a low heated burner to keep your coffee warmed while you spend interminable amounts of time feeding your grounds water. ('course you need the special, overpriced Chemix, heat transfer grill to put between your precious pot and the burner so pottie doesn't blow up...)

Top of this smaller than the Pyrex versions from the 1970s.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Nov. 20, 2022 Update: I need to knock off another star for issue with the filters. Because this new one is designed to have a smaller top portion that the original Pyrex one (about 3/4 inch shorter), the FSU-100 filters are problematic. They collapse and ripple at one spot on the 2 or 3rd pour of hot water, and the water bubbles and shoots out of the spout for some unknown reason. With the Pyrex one, the filter always stayed stuck to the wall all the way around and never ""bubbled"" from the spout. It's weird and requires a lot more attention as in I need to insert a straw for the spout, and press a spoon against the spot where it is ""rippling""--SUPER ANNOYING!!!

I put this next to my repaired pyrex chemex coffee maker that I paid a ridiculous amount for. The pyrex one has 3 raised bumps on the bottom (with the green patent stamp), and the top is higher and wider than this glass one. It supports the Chemex filters way better, hence why I prefer it over these glass ones. You must be super vigilant in handling these coffeemakers (glass or pyrex) as they break very, very easily. While cleaning it, I just slightly tapped it again the side of my sink and it broke. I did a load of dishes once, allowing them to dry on one side of my sink. Something shifted in the pile around the Chemex and broke another one. (I've gone through 5 of these: 4 glass + 1 pyrex.) I learned the hard way that you shouldn't put a GLASS Chemex coffeemaker full of ""hottish"" coffee in the fridge. It broke and left a huge mess for me to clean up. The Pyrex ones don't do that. If you are lucky enough to find a real vintage pyrex Chemex coffeemaker on Ebay in good condition, they will cost 2 to 3 times more than these new glass ones--because they are a fair bit more resilient. Beware though! A lot of vendors claim they are selling a ""Vintage"" pyrex Chemex coffeemaker, but it's usually one of this borosilicate glass ones. If it has a flat bottom and no green patent stamp, it's not made of pyrex!",L. Richard,Revisado en Canadá el 3 de septiembre de 2022
"Makes a superb cup of coffee, but ...","3,0 de 5 estrellas","A year ago, my expensive Capresso drip coffee maker bit the dust, and I decided I wasn't going to drop another $200+ on another electrical appliance, with plastic plumbing that was probably going to poison me. After doing some research, I settled on a Bodum French press, and fell in love with coffee all over again.

Unfortunately, I recently discovered that brewing coffee without paper filters leaves behind oils that can raise triglyceride levels in the bloodstream -- not a good thing for me. So, I begrudgingly went back to shopping for coffee makers. That was when I came across the Chemex product. This is a simple system that actually makes BETTER coffee than my French press, and without the sediment and messy clean-up. I dare say that the Chemex system makes the best coffee I have ever made.

However, some of the negative reviews here have merit. First, the dripping process takes a very ... looooooong ... time. And, unfortunately you can't just dump all of the hot water into the funnel and walk away -- you have to pour a little at a time and check back often to add more. This is largely due to Chemex's unique paper filter, which is twice as thick as the type you find in the stores. The entire process, from boiling the water to taking that first sip of coffee, takes a good 25 minutes. Bottom line: If you're in a hurry to get out the door in the morning, and not willing to get up a little earlier to make your coffee, forget it. I am seriously thinking of purchasing an electric kettle, with start/stop timer, to shave off the time it takes to boil water.

Second, due to the extended time it takes to drip the coffee thru the funnel and filter, your hot water will noticeably cool. By the time you're ready to pour the coffee into your mug, it may not please some who like their coffee piping hot. Wrapping a towel around the Chemex beaker helps insulate the carafe to minimize heat loss. Also, I have found that setting a small plate on top of beaker between the first and second cup is another way to slow the cooling process. (Some accessory marketing ideas for Chemex!)

Still, good things come to those who wait. If you are a coffee snob like me, and feel that life is too short to put up with mediocre coffee, you may very well find the Chemex brewing process to be a labor of love.",Topcat,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de marzo de 2013
"Disappoint as it is not quite the same, considering alternatives","3,0 de 5 estrellas","Chemex has changed the manufacturing. I broke my original and needed a replacement. It arrived and was 30% lighter and wooden collar fit poorly. In corresponding with Chemex, the advised they have been shifting to carafes being made in Germany via a new process that uses higher pressure allowing a thinner (therefore lighter) glass that is stronger. Hopefully I won't test if it is really stronger and there is no way of knowing the validity of their claim.

The iconic 2 piece collar doesn't this slightly different shape as well. In fact, it doesn't even touch the glass all the way around. My guess is that they have a stock of collars from the original carafe and are using them while carafes are coming from two sources. Unfortunately, that leaves the Germany-made carafes feeling cheap while the price point is anything but. I did have it replaced once as defective and the collar on the replacement is marginally better. I am seriously considering returning it and changing to a different manufacturer where the fit & finish are more appropriately aligned to price point.

Questionable strength of glass,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","The glass they use is arguably not quite fit for the purpose. I've had mine for about 18 months and it just broke while I was washing it. A 3"" x 1"" piece broke off the glass cone top. It wasn't cracked or chipped and I didn't knock it hard against anything. At the time it broke, I was using the washing brush recommended by Chemex. To be fair, it had a couple of very slight knocks over the months, and I suppose these must have created microscopic cracks that I couldn't see, but these knocks were very slight, and I'm thinking now this product cannot stand up to normal wear and tear. Certainly it never got dropped or anything like that, I'm just talking about tapping against the coffee cup when pouring. So I am not faulting myself for this breakage. If you think 18 months is all the life you should get out of this product, then it's a five-star. Me, I expect about five years. I will give it three stars because the coffee tasted good, but I am disappointed that it broke so soon. BTW, I've tried using superglue to repair the break, but that lasted only two days. I'm throwing it away now.

NB. A couple of readers have noted this review was not helpful. I challenge such people to stand up and state why it's not helpful to them. All I can think is these folk tell themselves I bashed the glass and don't want to own up to that. Honestly, that's not what happened.

"2 orders: 1st one Received 1/2 a broken item, 2nd one was perfect","3,0 de 5 estrellas","***OG Review @ top, 2nd review after UPDATE:***

So let me preface this with, Chemex coffee makers are amazing and we loved ours. We broke my S.O.’s that he’s used for years, so we needed a quick replacement because coffee withdrawal is a real thing. So we ordered the 10 Cup classic.

This is what we received. Boxes both intact, no damage to either box. The Chemex itself was just the top half, broken, with no bottom to it. But there was no broken glass in the box.

So someone went out of their way to take out the broken glass, but proceed to send out half a broken item? I’m obviously returning, and I would err to the side of caution when ordering from this seller. But still get a Chemex, because they’re amazing.

UPDATE: I took the risk of ordering another from this seller because 1-day shipping when you're a caffeine addict is too sweet of a deal. I'm glad I did, this time the Chemex was sent to us in perfect condition, no broken glass, not even a scratch.

"Great taste, must have time though","3,0 de 5 estrellas","Although this makes incredible tasting coffee, unless you buy the coffe-maker that goes with this, you'll be standing in front of your coffee maker with a boiling kettle, pouring water slowly over the grounds until it's brewed. Think about how long an automatic coffee maker takes to brew a full pot and that's how long you'll be standing over your new pot pouring water slowly over it. I used this twice then shelved it. I do not have the time in my mornings to spend 15 minutes physically making coffee. If you have the time, great, if not then I suggest a different coffee maker. Honestly it's as good as using a French Press, so I went back to that. Less time making incredible coffee.",Wbrodsky,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de agosto de 2021
Just OK,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This thing is fragile! While washing it, I tapped it against the side of the sink and chipped a large triangular shaped wedge off of the top portion. I used some epoxy to fix it but I'm not sure how long that will last.

Before purchasing this, I thought I could just fill the top section with boiling water and come back a little later to a nearly full bottom section. No way! I have to fill the top section 3 or 4 times before the bottom section is full. That's annoying. The next problem is when you fill the top section with water, the water begins to stream out of the bottom of the filter (Chemex brand of course) nicely till it reaches about half--then it slows dramatically to a drop or two per second. The only way to keep a steady stream as the water drains from the bottom of the Chemex filter is to suspend it away from the glass using my hands. That process still takes 3 or 4 minutes for each full top section multiplied by 3 or 4 fillups = 15 to 20 minutes, and my arms get tired by the time the bottom half is full. I didn't think it would involve this much work. Also, to be honest, I don't find the taste of the coffee to be any better than what came out of my cheap Black & Decker automated drip coffee maker. I have found that the trick to a better cup of coffee is keeping the coffee beans fresh in the freezer, and grinding them just before you make a pot of coffee.

The only place I can see where the Chemex coffee maker would shine is on a camping trip--just make sure that it is packed VERY carefully.",L. Richard,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de septiembre de 2012
"Love Chemex, unfortunately cheapening product.","3,0 de 5 estrellas","I have grown to revere chemex & pour over coffee as my favorite brewing method. I’ve been thru a few pour overs systems and seem to always come back to Chemex. I’ve been through about three now and I must say, even though I buy same model/type, over the years I notice the quality of the caraf declining. I just purchased this brewer and immediately noticed how light it felt. Every time I buy a new Chemex, it gets lighter and lighter. The navel on this particular caraf I do not like. It’s pointy and weird. It used to be soft and subtle with a better weighted glass. It used to feel pretty solid. This I worry will shatter easily. The wooden pieces do not align around the neck the way the older caraf would. I personally think the product is cheapening, though I pay the same amount of money. Mostly an observation, though. I still like brewing with this cheap ass Chemex and will continue to do so until I find something I like better.",Joey,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de junio de 2019
"Inferior to french press, but a great storage container!","3,0 de 5 estrellas","The Chemex is a work of art, but it can be a finicky coffee maker. The amount of coffee used, grind size, flow rate, water temperature / volume, bean roast - all of these variables play a role in the final product. The instructions are overly simplified - throw some beans in, add water, drink! You can definitely do that, but your coffee will most definitely come out tasting less-than-perfect. It's way more difficult than it should be to consistently make a truly great cup of coffee in this thing.

If you frequently need to make different amounts of coffee, or if you frequently switch from a dark roast to a light roast and back again, I would highly recommend you get a french press. Not only does the coffee taste much better, but it is also much, much easier to make a consistently perfect cup.

One thing the Chemex has going for it - it makes a great filter / storage container for iced-coffee in the fridge. I brew a large (40-50 ounce) french press pot, then pour it into the Chemex (through a Chemex filter to take out the sediment), then store it in the fridge for up to a week.

Hmmm...jury's still out fit us,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","We love coffee..GOOD coffee. We buy Starbucks beans (Sumatra is our fave) and have used both Mr. Coffee and Cuisinart coffee makers. I know, not of the caliber you would expect from coffee snobs but we hate the burnt coffee from the glass carafes and prefer to have the thermal carafes. And those are hard to find. Our Cuisinart piece of junk (always overflowed while brewing - I think lid couldn't keep up with brew cycle?!) but I couldn't source another maker with a thermal carafe that met our needs and budget. Thus, our purchase of the Chemex...what the heck, if we're gonna have to get glass, might as well do it right.

Aside from the fact that every morning feels like a chemistry experiment with the water boiling and fancy filtering and babysitting this thing while it ""makes"" your coffee, and aside from the fact that we cannot fit our tea kettle used to boil water under the filtered water dispenser on our fridge (which necessitates transfer of water from decanter into kettle for boiling), and aside from the fact that removing the leather-tied wooden holder is a pain in the butt but necessary for cleaning, I suppose it makes pretty good coffee.

"Works as advertised, but...","3,0 de 5 estrellas","Works as advertised, but has at least two problems in my opinion - 1) It is hard to clean because you can't get your hand down in the bottom section and using a bottle brush is tedious and doesn't work very well - 2) What's up with the Chemex filters for these things, they are basically a big square piece of filter paper folded twice to make a littler square that you then open one end of and insert into the top of the maker, that turns out to be a filter with one side three filter papers thick and the other side is one filter paper thick. Too much paper which soaks up more of the coffee oils and makes for a weak tasting cup of coffee, I ended up trying to use more coffee grounds to compensate for this but in the end it just did not work as well as it should have and we have now gone back to our old coffee making system.",Steve15,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de abril de 2018

Great - but REALLY FRAGILE!,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","We’ve bought two of these now, so obviously, we love it, but therein lies the problem - they keep breaking! And we’re not dropping them on the ground. The first one broke when my husband tapped it against the counter while moving it to the sink. The second, when he tapped it with a mug that he was pulling out of the cabinet. It’s made of glass, so obviously I would expect it to break if we were throwing it around or dropping it. But it seems a little crazy that a glance off a counter or a run-in with a mug would cause it to break the way it does. We’re considering getting another one, because again, we love it and use it all the time - but going through three a year is pretty steep.",Amethyst Moon,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de abril de 2020
No stopper or filters...,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","The Chemex is great, but it’s super inconvenient that it didn’t come with the stopper or filter (paper or reusable mesh,) and that those items were not “suggested with your purchase” items.

I feel I have wasted my money on an experiment - I was looking for better tasting coffee. I should have gotten the one with the handle. It is difficult for me to grasp the carafe by the wooden sleeve when it is full of hot liquid. My hands are too big, and holding it by the finger tips is problematic. Other people may not have such problems, but I do and I regret the purchase. So it is back to the old coffee maker for me - the flavor is not that much different.

Good but too much work,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","One of the best cups of coffee I ever had was brewed in one of these and the simplicity of this method is very appealing, but after several weeks of experimentation I've concluded that the beans, grind, and freshness are more important than the method. It's not so much that you have to wait for the water to drip through the filter, but that you have to stand over it waiting for the level to drop down while you keep pouring the hot water. To my taste, the french press is just as good and does not require the extra work.

It also seems a bit excessive to pay ten bucks for the glass stopper and that the filters are so much more expensive. The hassle level of keeping this clean should also be considered.",Gerald Shifrin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de diciembre de 2011
Looks Nice But...,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Nice design but so impractical. It doesn't hold heat at all. By the time I've put in all the water in the filter (have to wait for water to drip down), the coffee is lukewarm. The glass does get quite hot, so you have to use a potholder to handle it. Also, it is very difficult to clean, even with a bottle brush. I would not purchase this again.",Dawn,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de agosto de 2020

Quality is not as good as it used to be,"3,0 de 5 estrellas",My first Chemex broke and this new one that arrived to me is made of a lower quality material.

"Slow Mo Joe...geat tasting coffee, but somewhat of a tedious process","3,0 de 5 estrellas","After being a French Press user for many years I decided to try out the drip method again after having an amazing cup of coffe at Blue Bottle in San Francisco (a porcelin individual drip filter). The Chemex pots are nicely made and they actually feel more solid than other versions I've seen in the past. The down side is the how slowly the water filters through the beans. Maybe I'm grounding it too fine, but it's nearly impossible to get more than 3-4 cups out of what's supposed to be an 8-10 cup pot. The grounds turn to mud and even after stirring them up I'm not getting much liquid to drip through. I find the French Press coffee to be as good in flavor and strength at times with more immedate gratification than this pot. It does have a leg up in cleaning though--simply pull out the filter and toss it in the trash (doesn't seem as green however).",Sean M. Ryan,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de agosto de 2010

Having gone through two of these now I have to take a couple stars away.
1) The first one broke while being hand-washed in the sink. It lightly tapped the wall of the sink and the bottom broke out.
2) The replacement broke when we used it outside one cool morning. It was 55 degrees outside and when we poured the 200 degree water into it, the body shattered.

"Great coffee maker. Opt for classic wooden sleeve instead, though.","3,0 de 5 estrellas","This had a very small crack at the base of the handle which developed into a chip after two to three uses. I returned it and got the wooden sleeve Coffeemaker instead. If the coffeemaker is rinsed out with hot water soon after making the coffee and pouring it, there is no need to remove the wooden sleeve and, thus, no advantage to the glass handle.
As for the coffee it makes with Chemex filters, every boutique coffee roaster I order from rated at coffeereview.com recommens Chemex coffeemakers. All you need to do is heat water in an electric kettle and pour through the grinds and the advantage of an automatic coffeemaker that makes far inferior coffee disappears.",Frespkr,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de enero de 2013

My memory is probably faulty, but I remember the Chemex being fabulous to use, very easy, making good coffee. This time around, it's temperamental. The well fills with water when pouring over coffee grounds, making the drip very slow. We like strong coffee, and lots of it - the 10-cup is adequate, but we have to pour at least three times to get the amount we like, at the strength. It took donkey's years to find Chemex filters - after reading instructions for using them, I still don't get the reasoning behind placing 3-layers over the spout end, only one on the other. Maybe that's why the damn well fills up with water. I will not buy another Chemex again.",Teresa J. Black,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de mayo de 2014

A classic Drip Pot,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I like Strong Coffee and prefer a French Press, which is a full 'chewy' coffee with all the oils. I got this pot knowing I would need an espresso or a Melita grind for this drip pot. You need to pour two batches of hot water in, first to wet coffee then get most of the flavor out. Best to get the Chemex paper filters, which are effective in getting the Coffee oils out.

I recommend this pot for people who like a milder coffee, without bitterness or oil.
It truly makes smooth delicate coffee.

Not throwing away my French Press but makes great coffee!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Contrasting the Chemex to my other favorite method, the French Press:

The Good:
* Chemex coffee is clean and crisp. Full flavor, zero bitterness, and no sludge.
* I can leave the coffee in the pot on the stove (I have a glass top stove) to stay warm while I enjoy my first cup. Buy the glass lid to avoid evaporation if you're going to leave this on the stove a while.
* Easy to clean! Skip the special $8 bottle brush. I'm using a $2 bottle brush from WalMart and it works fine.

The Bad:
* Time. The Chemex requires a little more babysitting to maintain the ""bloom"". It's not a dump water in and walk away event.
* Coffee cools quickly. I brew on my glass top stove. Once enough coffee has filtered through I kick the burner on to keep the coffee hot while I finish brewing.
* Filters are harder to find locally and more expensive so you have to plan ahead and be prepared to pay extra. Note I order from Wire Whisk and they are AWESOME. Super fast shipping. Decent price.
* The filters pull out much of the oils, so the resulting coffee isn't as rich as French press.

It took me some time to calibrate coffee/water ratio. I find about 7g coffee/90ml water is about the right ratio. The instructions recommend 1 rounded tblspn to 5 oz of water. Which is close to my ratio depending on your definition of rounded tablespoon.

All told I'm a fan of the Chemex. Despite a small loss of richness, the overall quality is still awesome and I don't have to deal with the sludge and cleanup of a French press. I'm not throwing away my French press by any means, but won't use it unless I feel the type of coffee demands the extra richness.",MO,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de mayo de 2010

My coffee journey - Chemex: Tasty but a bit annoying,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","My beloved Braun coffeemaker died and for the next few months I found myself on an inadvertent coffee making journey. Though I am not a coffee snob - I am willing to drink almost anything bearing the name - I do buy my beans fresh from a local roaster (Coffee Labs of Tarrytown) and grind them in a burr grinder. And I do drink it black, no sugar. Five coffeemakers* later this is my story.

The Chemex makes the best* pot of coffee I found. Not quite as flavorful as the AeroPress but 42 oz per brew is a LOT better than 8 oz. Basically the 'secret' of the Chemex is that a 'coffee slurry' - a fairly dense suspension of coffee grinds in water - gets the most flavor out of the grounds. Unlike other 'pour over' systems, the huge size of the Chemex filters allows you to make a good slurry even with a full 14 teaspoons of grinds (for 42 oz of coffee). Also, the Chemex filters keep almost all of the oils and bitterness out of the coffee. It is easy to use and very easy to clean up. And I came to appreciate the fact that using the Chemex allowed my to choose my water temperature.*

TIPS - Use a Pyrex measuring cup as an intermediate point between kettle and Chemex. This allows you to easily measure the water going into your Chemex and also cools the water reducing the 'seconds off the boil' count. Pour in 8 oz of water to bloom the grinds and wait 30 seconds. Then add 12 oz of water and gently stir. Wait until the water goes down and repeat. Do one final time, throw away the filter and grinds and you should now have about 40 oz of very tasty coffee.

All that said, the Chemex currently sits on a display shelf in my Kitchen and only comes down when I feel like making something special on the weekend. Why? First and most foremost because all this takes time and attention - 10-15 minutes worth. And as I rise bleary eyed on a weekday morning I instead choose the BonaVita which needs me for about a minute then delivers not-quite-as-good-but-still-tasty coffee 5 minutes later. The other reason is that unless you are immediately serving coffee to guests the glass carafe means your coffee is getting cold fast.

Actually, I should point out that the Chemex is IDEAL for making coffee for guests - the carafe is beautiful, the whole boiling/grinding/pouring process looks cool, the intermittent attention for 15 min requirement is perfect for conversation, and the coffee is stellar.

*KitchenAid 12-cup Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker, Aerobie AeroPress, Bodum French press, Chemex 10-Cup Coffee Maker, Bonavita Coffee Maker with thermal carafe

*Temperature. The AeroPress recommends 175F degree water while the Specialty Coffee Association of America recommends 92C to 96C degree water (197.6 to 204.8 F). I found that when the water was around 190 degrees I liked my coffee best - to me that temperature delivered the fullest flavor with just a hint of bitterness. Lest you think me insane let me reassure you that I didn't sit there with a kitchen thermometer every time I brewed a cup/pot of coffee. You do it a couple of times to measure 'Seconds off the boil' vs temperature and go from there.

*Best Coffee. One thing I found while on this journey is that coffee preferences vary wildly. Some people hate any bitterness at all while others feel that coffee without any bitter notes is like wine without any acidity - insipid. Some people like a touch of coffee oils some like a lot and some like none. Perhaps most important of all is the issue of cream and/or sugar. My wife found that coffee she liked better black came out flavorless after soymilk was added while the previously 'too bitter' choice was perfect. I recently chatted with a barista in a coffeehouse who confessed that for the past few months he has come to like 'cowboy coffee' best - coffee brewed in a pot with the grinds inside.

"Expensive, but Exquisite.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Alright, the reviews so far on the Chemex coffee pot are pretty extensive, so I am going to just throw my two cents into your inner dialog purchase debate.

I purchased my Chemex about three weeks ago and have been using it, on average, twice daily. I have the 10 cup model with the molded-in handle.

The carafe says it will hold around 50 some ounces. I was concerned by this since I sometimes brew 64 ounce pots of coffee for my wife and me using 16 oz mugs. I have found however, that the Chemex is big enough to hold 64 oz, although it does fill the pot far past its intended fill line. The coffee still brewed very nicely and tasted normal after brewing a ""full"" pot.

The handle on the pot is very handy (no pun intended). Whether rinsing the pot, or pouring coffee, the handle feels well placed and strong. The Chemex has a groove that runs the better part of the pouring side of the carafe which provides great control when pouring. Aesthetically, the pot looks great sitting out on the counter, it is also a great conversation piece.

It should be noted that switching over to a Chemex is not for everyone. It takes considerably more time to brew a pot of coffee compared to using a drip machine. That said, your patients will be greatly rewarded with the best tasting cup of coffee you’ve likely ever had. Boiling water can take 5-10 min., another 2-3 min. for the water to reach 200 degrees, brew time between 4-5 min. As you can see, it usually takes me about 20 min. to make a proper pot of coffee. For this reason, I still keep my old drip machine for quicker brews when I’m rushed.

As far as results, they really speak for themselves when you drink your first Chemex pour-over cup. It’s fair to say if you’re reading this review, and considering buying a Chemex, then you are serious about your coffee. Having said that, I won’t bother everyone with lots of details about brewing methods, extraction times, grinds, etc… After all, learning about all this is one of the great joys of perfecting your perfect cup!
On a negative note, the price of this brewer is exorbitant. Sporting over a $60 price tag is steep considering that one mistake at the sink or counter could spell utter destruction of your coffee maker. It’s great knowing that if I take good care of my Chemex, and am very careful handling it, that it will likely last years; however, accidents happen, and if I accidentally shatter my Chemex, I could become mentally unstable from the lack of coffee coupled with the sticker shock of another Chemex.

Temperature. I always preheat my Chemex, and my reusable metal filter before each brew. I always brew with water just at 200 degrees. I have taken readings of my coffee temperature after pouring my first cup and it was around 165 degrees (very lovely). Going back for my second 16 oz cup the coffee is quite a bit cooler, around 125 degrees (not bad if you drink it fast). For this reason, I also use a good vacuum coffee carafe when brewing more than 32 oz of coffee. I have reheated coffee directly in the Chemex on my gas range; however, I would recommend a good carafe to reduce the risk of breaking your pot or scorching your coffee.

That’s it, the Chemex is a great coffee pot that brews a tremendously good cup of Joe. It’s easy to clean, simple to use, and the proof is in the pudding. The downsides are its high price, fragility, and lack of convenience.",Sarah Phillips,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de mayo de 2015
Love this pour over,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","It is a super basic pour over but it is cute to keep out on the table unlike a lot of coffee makers. We use a metal filter with it. The wood piece around the neck is actually two pieces tied together with a string and nothing else and they don't actually fit together well, there is a wedge-gap between them, but it doesn't really bother me. It is kind of hard to clean unless you have child-sized hands or a bottle brush and the wood has faded after inadvertently getting it wet a few times, but honestly its kind of got a boho vibe to it anyway so that doesn't bother me either. Maybe don't buy it if you like fine attention to details because its not perfect but it works perfectly for making coffee!",Lauren,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de julio de 2023
Great in for 750ml or less. Larger pots take a lot of practice.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Chemex coffee is fantastic if you want a clean, clear nuanced cup for especially from lighter or medium roasts. Personally I prefer the more full bodied feel and flavor of an immersion method like, French press, clever dripper (my favorite) or an AeroPress.

I bought this to make larger batches of coffee for entertaining guests than my 32oz French press would allow me to. However, in my experience, chemex is terrible for large batch brewing.

The brew time is contingent on the size of the brew and if you use a standard 60grams per liter ratio of coffee to water you will get 7-9 minute over extracted brews if you are trying to brew the full capacity of the 10 cup model (1.5 liters).

Yes, you can increase the grind size, use a fine sieve to filter out fines, and decreases water temperature but still in my experience if you try to brew the 10 cup model’s full capacity of 1.5 liters you will get gross coffee.

As for making 750ml or less the chemex is the best pour over I’ve had. And it’s beautiful to look at also. But the last thing you want is to have a bunch of friends over to impress with your amazing coffee only to brew a sour batch 1 out of 3 tries.

Here is a recipe for brewing 1.25 liters instead of the full 1.5. I find brewing the full 1.5 liter quantity impossibly inconsistent but this is decent.

10 cup chemex recipe

* 75 grams coffee ground as course as the grinder will go (like French press or a little courser) to 1.25 liters water (just add the additional water to get to 1500 if you have a large group who don’t like strong coffee [snag the first strong cups for the real coffee people who like it right then add the 125 grams water to get to 1500])
* Sift ground coffee in fine strainer to remove fines: be thorough! If fines are continuing to fall out then keep sifting.
* Use water below 200F
* Make sure the filter does not collapse into the spout as this will stop the flow and cause too long of a brew time. Lift and rotate a few degrees to solve this. Of course the 3 plu side of the chemex filter should be against the spout side in the first place to create regidity and to prevent collapsing.

This should give a brew time of around 4-4.5 mins and not be bitter.",Hollimans,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de agosto de 2019
10-cup model takes some practice,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","The Chemex brand is wonderful. Coffee brewed on a Chemex vastly surpasses coffee brewed by any other means. I love my 10-cup model. Why 4 stars, then?

The nature of the 10-cup model is tricky. I bought it so that I could have a larger model for larger crowds. Grind more beans, boil more water, etc, etc. Easy enough, right? It takes some practice.

First of all, the amount of water needed is misleading. The model is for 10 cups. What Chemex doesn't tell you is that their ""cup"" is measured at 5 oz, as opposed to the standard 8 oz. Do some math and you'll find that the 10-cup model, with that in mind, holds a total of 50 oz. Now, if you weigh out your coffee and water in grams - as you should - you'll find some disconcerting news. 50 oz = 1478.7 mL = 1478.7 g. To brew a full pot you'll need 1478.7 g of boiling water (and that's not including the water needed to rinse the filter.) Do a quick amazon/web search and you'll find that pretty much the largest gooseneck kettle on the market is only 1.2 L. That's 1200 g of water maximum. That means that unless you have an assistant on hand constantly boiling more water for you in separate kettles while you pour over an ocean of grounds, you'll probably never actually make 10 cups of coffee. The solution? I thought backwards. If I could only fit 1200 g of water in my kettle, then I would fill it to the very brim, grind 80 g of beans (1:15 coffee to water ratio), and start pouring. (I initially boiled more than that in a larger pot so that I would have enough at the jump to rinse the filter.)

As for the beans, 80 g is quite a lot. If you thought you knew what coarse meant before, you ain't seen nothing yet. Go coarser and coarser, and then go coarser after that. I had my grinder - a Baratza Preciso - set at the coarsest setting and the total brew time was still around 9 minutes. I find that 7-8 minutes works best for this amount of coffee.

Also, for whatever reason you might find that the brew starts to ""stall"" around the 5/6 minute mark. I don't know why. Just give the spout-side of the filter a little peel backwards to get it flowing again.

Obviously adjust for your own desired amount of coffee. But then again, if you want less coffee shouldn't you just bust out the ol' 6-cup model instead?",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de abril de 2016
Excellent Coffee *updated* but brittle glass.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","A little background of my coffee-drinking history first. I've owned a black Mr. Coffee coffee maker for probably 8-10 years. It does it's job but not a GREAT job. I occasionally will grab a cup from work, which is low grade awful and unfiltered but it does what it's supposed to: give me energy. I never buy at starbucks or any other coffee shop mainly because that is a waste of money IMO. Why would I pay alot of money (and use gas) to get a single cup? So basically I make my own coffee at home.

I bought this because my Mr. Coffee was finally starting to bite the dust and I wanted something useful at home that doesn't require a hot plate or use alot of electricity. I also wanted a better tasting cup. The reviews of this coffeemaker were promising so I clicked ""add to cart"" and I AM GLAD I DID!

I made my first cup this morning and OMG-WTF-GTFO was it an OUTSTANDING cup of coffee. I could pretty much say it was the best cup of coffee I've had in years. It tasted so smooth and not a hint of bitterness that I'm used to. Amazing.

I used the proper filters for this coffeemaker and used Seattle's Best Organic Level 4 coffee with organic vanilla coffee creamer.

Update: I am updating my review and ratings based on a small defect. I read lots of reviews prior to buying this and quite a few spoke about the glass being brittle and breaking so I took extreme care with my glass c-maker since the day I got it. I use a soft counter top pad underneath it so it doesn't ""bang"" on the counter top. I was also very careful when washing it, not to hit anything in the sink. So far I've not banged or hit it on anything and I noticed a small hairline crack on the handle. I can understand a crack at the lid or at the bottom somewhere but not on the handle, which is in your hand all the time and never gets hit on anything? The crack is starting to get longer by the day and it's only a matter of time before it breaks off. Maybe it will still be useful when it does break off so we'll see. I removed one star due to the glass being extremely brittle and breaking (starting to) in places that normally would not break. It still makes wonderful coffee though.",Muddeprived,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de julio de 2015
"Elegant, But Time Consuming","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I've only just received this coffee maker, so this review represents my first thoughts. Will revise after further use.
As my title suggests this is a very good looking coffee maker. Almost a piece of art. I purchased--but did not need to use--the company's quite expensive filters. The high quality unbleached cone-shaped filters you can buy in a store like Meijer's (midwest chain)work fine, especially if you're doing 4 or less cups (at 6 oz per cup). It definitely makes good coffee after you figure out the proportions that will work for you, and the instructions about wetting the grounds a little and letting them bloom before SLOWLY pouring in the hot water is excellent advice. It makes good coffee, but using the same grind I always have used for drip coffee (whole beans that I grind), I had some sediment in my 12 oz mug of coffee each time. This never happens with the standard auto-brew coffee makers we have used. Perhaps this would go away if I used their massive filters. Bring your water to a boil and then let it sit 30 seconds for the proper temperature.
My main complaint is that when you clean it, it makes the most sense to disassemble the collar around the middle unless you want water trapped behind the wooden and leather tied--though nicely ornamental--protective collar. A hassle, but over time, I think that thing would get grungy without doing that.
I found that this coffee maker and its method required slightly more grounds than my previous formula with auto-drip.
And then there's the top I purchased along with the filters: overly expensive and just waiting for the day it can break. It's heavy, flops out easily and centers itself too far down in the top of the glass carafe. Absolutely no way this should have been a separately purchased part, let alone cost what it did.
Finally, the whole process is fine if you are into a kind of ""tea ceremony"" but with coffee. It's a fairly long and complicated process, but it has it's value in centering yourself on a ritual that will bring you to a rewarding cup of coffee.",Richard Spafford,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de septiembre de 2013
It makes great coffee when you've worked out a system.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","It's taken me a while to work out a system that works for me for using my Chemex 40 ounce coffee pot , but now that I have I can make consistently good coffee with it.
In addition to the coffee pot I use a Java press hand cranked coffee grinder, an electric kettle, and a four cup measuring cup. The way I do it the only thing I have to measure is the amount of water I use. hence the measuring cup. The coffee grinder uses about 125 ML of coffee beans and that seems to be just the right amount for four measuring cups of hot water. It took some experimentation on my part to find a setting for the grinder which suited me and the coffee pot. I'd say my grind is a bit coarser than a medium grind.

I use the unbleached coffee filters and pour a little hot water through the filter before I add the coffee. I think rinsing the filter removes or at least minimizes the taste of the paper filter and it also warms the pot a little before you pour the larger portion of the just off the boil water into the pot. I've been using Mocha Java coffee which is medium blend and I drink it black so i might be making my coffee lighter than people who use cream and sugar. Presently I'm reheating my cups of coffee in the microwave, but I'm considering getting an insulated stainless steel carafe to store the coffee and keep it hot. A friend says microwaving the coffee makes it bitter, but I have to believe he's overheating the coffee because I don't get that from just warming it up, so I'm undecided about the carafe at present. All in all I'm very happy with making coffee this way.",Speedy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de agosto de 2019
"Makes good coffee, but craftsmanship not great","4,0 de 5 estrellas","The Chemex makes very good coffee. Based on that, I’d give it 5 stars. However, I gave it 4 stars due to the craftsmanship of the carafe. The glass carafe is great, but the wooden ring around it has some issues. It’s a two piece ring that comes together in the back of the carafe. It doesn’t come together flush, so there’s a bit of a gap. It’s unclear to me if it’s supposed to be glued together in the back. The reason I say this is because there’s some glue that sloppily overspilled onto the wood near the gap. Where the wood ring meets the spout on the front of the carafe, the wood edges are rough and not sanded, so there are little pieces of wood that stick out from where the edges were cut.",Shari K.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de enero de 2023

Makes Good Coffee; Perfects your Self-Righteous Coffee Snobbery,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I work with an arrogant coffee snob, who does nothing but wank on about how superior his taste is to everyone else's. In fact, no one knows ANYTHING about food or coffee or art but him. He's the world's expert on everything. So when I was setting up our new office, I left it up to HIM to decide our method for brewing. I knew he would choose this.

To be fair, it's an easy set up. You can't get much simpler! As far as clean up; it's certainly easier to clean than a regular old drip coffee maker. (Drip coffee maker? The HORROR! He wouldn't be caught DEAD drinking from one and he'd rather die of a caffeine-withdrawal headache than do so.) It's pretty to look at and so far I have not managed to break it, so I think it's a very good product.

I like the coffee it makes. Of course, Coffee Snob puts in about 10 tablespoons for 2 cups of coffee. I put 3-4 tablespoons for 2 cups of coffee and my brew is crisp and clean and delicious. His method makes coffee mud, but of course, I'm an unwashed plebian, so what do I know about flavor?

This is not the coffee maker for you if, like me, you can hardly function in the morning without your morning coffee. It takes just a bit longer to brew.... because you have to carefully and slowly pour the hot water over the grounds. You can't just make it and leave it like you would with a coffee maker. The wait can be excruciating if you are really dragging. But if you are a bonafide coffee snob, this painful process is what makes the coffee WORTH IT. That's what I hear anyway.

"Elegant, but cheap glass","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I decided to give pour-over-coffee a try, and so I bought this Chemex with a gooseneck electric kettle. Currently I am using a cheap $20 blade grinder, but even then the resulting coffee from this is amazing. My first attempt I failed miserably because my coffee grinds were too course. Second attempt I got much better results, and I was amazed at the flavor. I can never go back to drip coffee again. The resulting coffee from pour over methods is so much more rich and bold.

One thing to point out - this does NOT come with any filters! I fully expected there to at least be a small trial pack of filters included in the box given the price. When the box arrived I found that was not the case, so I had to order and wait on a metal filter insert to arrive. For the amount of money spent on a cheap glass vase basically, I would have expected a couple of filters in the box at least.

The make of this product is cheap. You can feel it when you lift the cheap glass. I’m worried it will break easily. But, it looks elegant. We will see how it holds up over time.",Mandy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de mayo de 2020
Never knew coffee could be this good!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Love, love this coffee maker. I have always been a Bunn lover but after tasting the coffee that this one makes, the Bunn is now officially retired and put away. Even my husband, who is not a coffee aficionado, loves this coffee. I typically use Starbucks Italian Roast, French Roast or Columbian but no matter which one, the coffee comes out smooth, no bitter taste, no acidic taste and the perfect strength (I like the stronger side).

I use approximately 1 tablespoon per 4-5 ounces of water. I usually end up making about 20 ounces at a time as we use large mugs. I followed the directions that came with the coffee maker and it was spot on. I did cheat a little and googled the best way to make coffee with the Chemex. Don't forget or side step the ""blooming"" process that the included directions mentions and the internet insists on for the best coffee. Very important.

I would have given this a 5 star but the drawback to this coffee maker is that you can't keep the coffee warm. I have tried putting it on the ""warming"" burner but if it sits for any time at all...well, it just isn't as good. So, I have to make just the right amount for immediate indulgence and know that I will have to make it again if we want more.

I also want to note that making coffee this way is not a fast process. From start (hand grinding the beans) to finish, it takes me about 20 min. to make the 20 ounces.

"Works and looks fantastic, but dumping it will be challenge for smaller hands","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Best cup of coffee I've ever had was in a small coffee shop that served coffee from local roasters, and they used the slow pour over method to brew. So when I got home I immediately started looking these up. I have a french press that I've been using at work, and the coffee is delicious and consistent. But for the home I wanted something a little better since it didn't matter about the length of time it takes to brew.

The first cup I made with this was using a cheap filter from a supermarket and the coffee was rich, bold, and delicious. I used fresh ground beans from a local roaster that sells at a farmers market near me and the experience was pretty magical. I bought the super expensive Chemex filters and it actually took me a bit to get the coffee to the same level of delicious that I experienced that first brew. But once I did, I can say that I'm never going to truly be satisfied with the French Press again. The filter on the press does bleed some grounds through, even using a ceramic hand grinder modified with Orphan Espresso's mod to the Hario for press bearing to get even grounds. A paper filter just cleans up the coffee and the pour over is a slow, nonmechanical peaceful meditative method of brewing that calms me down in the morning.

I'd buy the one with a handle for smaller hands, even though in my opinion the wood sleeve looks better. The 10 cup is pretty wide in the neck, and I'm always afraid my wife will drop it when she's pouring.",Jacky S,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de enero de 2014

Still very good - almost great,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Updated review - 2 years later: We are still using the 10-cup Chemex and will stay with it. In between we've tried a Cuisinart drip (stinky residue) and a Bodum drip (stains in carafe) and rejected both. French press made good coffee but was muddy. We've accidentally broken the Chemex carafe 3 times over this period (so be careful handling). Best coffee is still Chemex.

*************************************************************************************************************************

The 10-cup Chemex is very good - almost great. The resulting coffee is excellent. (I use Costco's San Francisco Bay Organic Rainforest Blend beans. Approx $6 per pound. I grind them coarse in a burr grinder.) For fans of instant gratification and folks with little patience this may not be for you. For me the few minutes of waiting while water drips is tolerable given the result. However it isn't a zen experience as some have commented.

One negative: the 10-cup carafe is clumsy to handle when full of hot coffee. I'm a guy and I have big hands and I have to hold the wood portion of the carafe with two hands to pour when it's full and hot. With one hand I make contact with the hot glass.

In spite of this drawback I'll likely stick with the Chemex because of the great coffee.",Foofoodust,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de septiembre de 2017
"not the fastest, but the simplest way to make great coffee.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","The chemex makes delicious coffee. The pour over method is the simplest method for great coffee. I love that I do not need to plug it in. It's glass, so it's pretty fragile, but no more fragile than any other glass carafe. It can take a few minutes of hands on work, more than for an automatic drip. But it does not hog an outlet on my tiny kitchen counter, and I can stash it in a cabinet when not in use, as opposed to an automatic drip. If you need your coffee ready by the time you walk into the kitchen, this tool is not for you. But if you have a few minutes to boil the water on the stove and then stand over your coffee pot , Chemex might be your best bet.",ERL daGerl,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de abril de 2021
"Great Coffee, Simple To Use","4,0 de 5 estrellas","After spending years using an electronic drip coffee maker, then graduating to an aero-press (which I still love), I decided to give the Chemex a whirl.

The brewing process is really quite simple. Insert the filter into the top of the Chemex, add coffee and then pour over hot water which will then drip through to the bottom chamber. It takes a few attempts to figure out exactly how much coffee to add and how much water to pour over (there are no cup markings on the outside of the Chemex like with traditional drip brewers), but after my third or fourth brew I found the magic ratio. I also found that the first couple of brews resulted in lukewarm coffee because it can take 5-6 minutes for the brew to complete and there's no electric heating element to keep the Chemex coffee warm. However, I was able to solve this problem by pouring some boiling water into the Chemex before brewing and gently swishing it around the bottom chamber - which heated up the brewing chamber and really helped improve the temperature of the coffee.

The coffee itself tastes very clean - definitely on par with what I was making via the AeroPress and definitely better than a drip brewer. Clean-up is easily and overall I'm happy with this purchase.",Jon,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de enero de 2016

Better coffee than Kurig but more time consuming,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased the 8-cup glass handle Chemex after becoming increasingly disappointed with the taste from my Kurig. I did some research and decided on the Chemex over the French Press as I prefer having a paper filter vs a metal one. I have only been using this about a week now, but like it so far. I do prefer the all glass version since I can put it in the dishwasher once a week to clean it. Removing the bamboo would be unnecessary steps. For daily cleaning, I use a bottle brush with soapy water, rinse and let air dry. No discoloring or buildup so far. As far as the taste of the coffee, I'm still fine tuning my process, but it's significantly better than the Kurig I'm replacing. Finding the proper water vs coffee ratio is trial and error but I think I've got it now. Also it's important to find the proper grind. Too coarse and the water seeps out too fast and you get weak coffee, but too fine and the water seeps too slowly. The whole process of boiling water and waiting for it to ""brew"" is more time consuming though. For my husband rushing out the door in the morning before work, he is still using the Kurig for convenience. But I've got more time in the morning and do not mind the routine.",C and M,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de marzo de 2017

It delayed us using it for a few weeks and we wasted about 10 dollars in coffee trying wrong filters and quite a bit more money and time to get the wrong ones.

Not worth it if you want hot coffee- but good if many strong coffee drinkers in the house,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","My husband bought this for the purpose of making larger cups of coffee instead of his 1 cup maker. He loves coffee this way because he says its stronger... He has been making these larger pots of coffee and then I end up throwing out the majority. I have included proof of his waste for your review. Lol.

So yes, here I am, an annoyed wife stating this was a waste of money because we already have a 1-2 cup one like this AND have a keurig that can give him one hot cup at a time. Since he doesn't ever have to wash a cup in our house, he doesn't realize the waste it causes! I have very limited counter space at my house, yet here it sits after he takes ONE cup!! Ha

Oh one more thing, he said he doesn't like that his coffee pot doesn't stay warm long enough, I said ""that's what a coffee maker is for!!!"" So my thought...unless you both are strong coffee drinkers, opt for a smaller version of this and save your money.

Best Way to Brew Coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used Chemex since the 1970s and always preferred it to any other way of brewing coffee (other than espresso). However, the pot I just received, while it appears identical to the one that broke, does not fit the wooden handle pieces well. There's a gap that looks like the shape of the wood isn't quite right to snug up against the shape of the glass.",Orca,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de octubre de 2022
Great coffee with some effort required.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This Chemex coffee maker makes great, smooth tasting coffee. It takes a few tries to figure out the correct coffee/water ratio, and could benefit by some sort of volume markers on the glass to ensure precise measurements. There is one ""bump"" in the glass that could be used to estimate volume, but nothing else. I do like how the Chemex eliminates the coffee grind residue/sludge on the bottom of your cup that is present when using a French press.

Cleaning has been a bit of an experiment. I've tried rinsing immediately after drinking, without scrubbing, and it seems to do the trick. When the coffee is left in the chemex for a while and leaves some coffee stains, then it becomes more of a chore to clean and requires a brush. Another question is whether to remove the wood handle and leather strap when cleaning. If you do anything other than a quick rinse, both parts are bound to get wet, and water gets stuck between the wood and glass. I don't believe either are waterproof, though the wood has a poly-coating, and the leather has potential to get mildew or water-related wear if it gets soaked too often without a quick dry.",BH,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de julio de 2014
This works great. Also if you are straining any other juice,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I would give this 5 stars if it was easier to clean. I’m not sure if there is a special brush to clean it. But aside of that, I have used it for my coffee and juicing other things. I didn’t want to spend the money on their coffee filters so I have a nut bag that I put over top and then a regular cheep coffee filter inside. This works great. Also if you are straining any other juice.... my nut bag lays in the top nicely while I pour. I used this the last two days to make my wheat grass juice. (Blend wheat grass in blender with water and pour through bag in to the container) I didn’t notice it from the pictures but there is a groove opposite from the handle that allows for easy pouring. I hope I don’t break it on my granite counter as I am a klutz...but I love it. Will definitely be a regular item in my kitchen.

CONS- My biggest issue is that it doesn't come with the filter. Had to buy the filter separate for like $20...I just feel like for the price, it should be included.

"Happy, but frustrated","4,0 de 5 estrellas","We LOVE Chemex coffee, but read on. First discovered this over Thanksgiving when Boyfriend's mother pulled one out of the closet that she's had since the 60s. Fell in love with the coffee. Bought one in early January. Last night, the thing sprung a leak near the bottom. Had to be thrown out (didn't help that I dropped it on the tile floor transferring it to the sink), but I digress. My guess is that you should give the water a minute or so to cool down before you pour it into the Chemex. I'm betting that pouring the water immediately after it boils is just too much for the thing. One other word of advice - Chemex takes a few minutes and requires your full attention during brewing because you have to keep pouring water into it. If I know I'm going to be in a hurry in the morning, I program the autodrip the night before to save myself 10-15 minutes. Still, it's great coffee, we love it, and I will buy another one (probably before the sun sets) and let the water cool down for 60-90 seconds after boiling and before pouring.",LHK,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de marzo de 2010
Fragile work of beauty,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","The fragile glass will break if you don't take good care of it, and its not cheap to replace.
Some reviews suggested to use other brands of glass like Pyrex for container function, since the magic of brewing really depends on the chemex filter paper, I would agree for most part, but the Chemex glass is tailored for the filter paper perfectly for the convenience of the brewing drip. If you take good care of the glass, like find a designated drying place for it everyday (not on your dish rack), I doubt it will break on its own. And I would avoid heating the glass over fire or heating pads that might cause heat fractures.

The glass is a work of beauty to appreciate the art of coffee brewing. My final suggestion is buy the one without the wooden handle. you don't really need a handle for most part except when you first pour hot water in. That's where the glass handle comes in handy, but even the handle looks fragile. I usually grab it by the neck to clean the glass during rinse.

Chemex 8-cup Coffee Maker,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I've had both the older, classic Chemex coffee maker -- the one with the two-part birch handle, secured with rawhide -- and this newer design, with the integrated glass handle. Although the classic design is in many ways more beautiful, the glass-handle model is far more practical. You can put the coffee maker in the dishwasher, and there is no wooden handle to split or warp, something that eventually happens with the classic model, no matter how careful you are. Of course they both make great coffee, as long as you rememeber to use real Chemex filters and, of course, to ""blast the beans"" with water just below the boiling point.

One final point: this is a coffee maker designed for someone who wants real, flavorful, strong coffee and is willing to take five or ten minutes to achieve it. It's not for those times on sleepy Monday mornings, when all you want is a vehicle for infusing caffeine into your system. You might want to consider two coffee makers, an automatic drip system for your daily, morning brew and a Chemex coffee maker for when you have more time, in the evening or on the weekend.",Brian in Palm Springs,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de marzo de 2011
"In retrospect, I would go with the 6-cup","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Beautiful, simple, and it makes great coffee. It makes a bit more coffee than advertised, because you can just keep filling it past the little dot.

However, I also bought the 6-cup version for work, and I prefer it because the 3-cup version's resevoir (what I'm calling the space on top that holds the water as it drips) isn't big enough to fill the bottom area up to the dot. This makes sense, because if it were big enough, it would probably tip over because the 3-cup version is slimmer.

By contrast, the 6-cup version's resevoir is the right size, so you fill it, let it drip, and it pretty much fills the bottom to the right level.

The consequence is that with the 3-cup version, you spend a few minutes filling the top and letting it drip into the bottom, then filling it again and letting it drip, until it reaches the dot. I'm not as devoted to my coffee-making routine as the makers of Chemex - I prefer to pour once and come back in a few minutes when it's done.

Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but I prefer making coffee with the 6-cup version.",namewhatname,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de mayo de 2013
works well but have some regrets,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","first of all, the chemex coffee system definitely lives up to the hype. i just wish i had done a little more research before buying this model. while the wood and leather ""handle"" look great at first, they become pretty janky looking after a few months of use and washing. and when its full of coffee it becomes straight up hazardous to carry only by the neck (i'm a lady with smaller hands and its tough to fully grip the chemex; when it's full it becomes quite heavy).
other than that, no complaints. the 10cup is a bit large for my boyfriend and i but it's nice to have for when we have guests. even using the same cheap(ish) whole foods coffee that we used in our automatic coffee maker the improvement is noticeable. increased sweetness and decreased bitterness, and much easier to keep warm over the gas burner without risking burning it or getting a gross plasticy smell like we did with the automatic.",jr,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de mayo de 2014

I’m thinking I’ll send this little one back and get the 6 cup. Also, by the time the coffee is done, it is no longer hot, especially after adding any milk. I’ve been nuking it, but am not very comfortable with that. I will have to get used to pouring it into a pan and heating it up on the stove. Meanwhile, however, I will put my sewing skills to use and make a “coffee cozy” with reflective batting inside, to see if that will help. incidentally, I always grind decaf and regular together (Organic), so I can get the strong flavor without so much caffeine.

In a nutshell,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I wouldn't necessarily say our Chemex 10 cup makes the best coffee I've ever tasted, but the coffee's certainly very good. We bought the Chemex to replace an 8 cup cafétière (French press) that made different, thicker but equally good coffee. Making coffee with the cafétière, though, meant that after the first pour the coffee became increasingly muddy. Our Chemex makes enough coffee at a consistent strength for the two of us to have two decent helpings each in the morning. Making the coffee in a Chemex is more effort at the beginning but far easier to clean up at the end than with a cafétière. I would recommend first rinsing the Chemex filters with hot water (and thereby also warming the Chemex glass) to get rid of as much papery taste as possible. Having a tiny galley kitchen, we like using a manual coffee maker, which doesn't clutter the countertops, together with an electric kettle and the Chemex works well without seeming too fragile.",Crispin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de enero de 2010

With unbleached filters, it is less gritty when french press and way easer to clean. You can control the taste with the grind, bloom, etc. I added the wood handle cover from my 1st broken Chemex to this handled one which I wish was an option. A 5 star product with a 3 star build quality. The glass could be x2 times the thickness they really do skimp on the density which is pretty much the only downfall of the Chemex. 8 cup is a good size for 2 people, it yields about 4 mugs of coffee total.

I also purchased the additional cover, but I question how effective it is at retaining heat.

My one gripe with the Chemex is that it is fragile. I have broken two of them in the last 3 months. I admittedly had the first one for over a year. The second one lasted just shy of 6 weeks. I accidentally smacked it with the kettle...the kettle won.

One word of warning - even this relatively large 10 ""cup"" model is a fairly small volume - about four normal coffee mugs is the total capacity. So, if you are going to use it to replace a more conventional perk or drip coffee maker, you might want to go with a large model to have a comparable capacity.",surffisher,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de febrero de 2017
Difficult to pour coffee with one hand,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Makes good coffee but pouring is difficult with one hand. Holding onto the wood grips, my hand also touches the hot glass. A hot pad in the other hand holding the bottom is required. I ordered the Chemex with the glass handle. I'll use this one for mixing cocktails.",Craig Miller,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de julio de 2021
Brewed a tasty cup of coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I was looking for a tasty cup of coffee – no acid, no coffee grounds - and I found it in this little glass pot. Since you control how quickly boiling water hits the coffee and how much water is poured on, you control the flavor of the coffee. It’s better than a French press because there are no coffee grounds to dig out of the bottom of the pot. It’s better than a Mr. Coffee because the hot water is not going through plastic to get to the coffee. The flavor of the coffee comes through without anything else to mask the flavor. You do need to spend a minute or so pouring the water on the coffee, but the result is better and maybe a little Zen time is good before you get that caffeine jolt. I don’t think it makes a full 3 cups of coffee, but my cup could be a bit on the large size.",Bessie Smith,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de febrero de 2013
Deliciously Sustainable Solution for Making Coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","When I was looking for a coffeemaker, I was looking for something with minimal parts, simple cleanup, little to no plastic parts, and obviously, great tasting coffee. This is a pretty perfect thing. Single material, easy cleanup (just toss the coffee grounds into the compost or trash and rinse the glass right after making it), very pure tasting coffee. Normally I have to put cream and sugar in my coffee, but with this method, I really don't need to anymore. The taste is already pretty smooth.

The only negative I have about this product is that the coffee cools quite rapidly, so you have to drink it quickly. However, since the first time making coffee with this, I have been better about my process and now my cups have been nice and hot.

I also enjoy the process of just making the coffee. It's kinda like magic in a way.",Midwest Lass,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de noviembre de 2012
Lovely but fragile,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I do love my Chemex brewed coffee. It's been my daily ritual for over a decade. But over the years, the quality of the glass seems to be getting worse. I remember when it was thick and sturdy. Today it breaks very easily, so please be careful when you wash it. These days, I manage to shatter one every 6 months or so. I just keep a few extra in my closet. C'est la vie.",Mr. E,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de noviembre de 2018
Good concept - lacks durability,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","If this thing was made of Pyrex... or glass thicker than 1/16"" I'd give it a 5 star rating... but it feels like you may break it while washing it.

Otherwise, it produces a superb cup of coffee - I bought this as a gift for the parents and they loved it (I don't drink coffee myself, but everyone was raving how it was the best cup they'd had).

One major difference - I also bought them the KONE by Coava (the $50 metal filter) which they seemed to prefer over disposable filters. A great concept, and a good looking product, but this thing would never survive in my home. Also, my parents thought the 8 cup was too small... it's about the size of a pitcher... my parents are just addicted to coffee.",Brian Konar,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de enero de 2011

Nice product but...,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Overall a nice product but a bit pricy.
I have just one little problem, when I put the filter in and fill up with water it starts to splash hot drops since the air needs to come out some way, hence it gets messy.
I will try with different filters, hopefully its just a metter of material that filters are made of.",Beata,Revisado en Reino Unido el 16 de octubre de 2020
A great artesian way to make your own signature coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","After 17 years of using our excellent Technivorm moccamaster coffee maker, we have stored it away.

Excellent Coffee Maker,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","The Chemex makes excellent coffee simply because you're in charge of the coffee making process. You boil the water, control the temperature and the pour rate. The Chemex is all glass so there's no chance of a plastic taste unless you use one of those electric hot water heaters with the plastic heater elements. This particular model has undergone a slight redesign. The spout is narrower than the old model, which is a good thing because the paper filter is less likely to collapse into the spout and prevent air from getting into the Chemex and slowing the process. The only downside is that the top that holds the filter is slightly smaller than the old model so you can't pour as much water in, but this isn't a major deal.

All in all, one of the best ways to make coffee.",R. Williams,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de julio de 2013

Best chance at perfect Drip coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is our third chemex -- the others got broken. You would think that a glass cone and proprietary filter paper would not have much impact on coffee brewing, but somehow it does.

I do indeed recommend this to friends.",Tom Williams,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de marzo de 2020
Remember to buy filters!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Was really excited to get our new Chemex in the mail, but quickly disappointed when we discovered no filters with the carafe.

Gotta love it & the coffee it makes.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","As a gift, it totally fit the bill - nice quality, modern yet classic, requested... Bit disappointed at how easily it breaks, but that's the way of glass items. Having a pour-over gives a great opportunity to chat and catch up while you wait, so I'll always lean this way when I have a choice.

Makes great coffee with few parts,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",Makes great coffee with few parts. Clean up is easy. This is the second one I have purchased. Only 4 stars because the product doesn't come with even 1 filter to get you started.

Amazing coffee!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I have tried a regular brewer, keurig, and French press but the Chemex wins. Best flavor. So smooth and flavorful!

"Simple to use, good coffee.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","So simple. Put in a filter, add coffee, pour hot water over it, drippity drip, drink.
There are several sizes available from these guys - this one works for me and I like having the handle rather than that weird wooden belt thing to grip it by. I discovered that their branded filter papers are better than trying to just use cheapie grocery store ones, but those will work too. The flimsier ones bend themselves into the groove and create a seal, which can lead to a burbly mess as displaced air in the bottom chamber tries to escape, bringing coffee with it. If you want to use the cheap filters, lay a straw inside the groove so there's a place for the air to escape. Whether the flavor is better with their branded filters is a holy war I'm not getting into.",Jen,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de marzo de 2010
It’s what she wanted.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this for my mother’s birthday. The only reason it doesn’t get 5 stars is that she she needed to buy additional things to use it even once.

Lovely design. Bit better than an ugly filter coffee machine!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Just to say I love this for its aesthetics and minimalist design. But ultimately all it does is hold a coffee filter at a small distance above a vessel, into which coffee is created. Hmm. So why the fancy branding pamphlet inside it which says stuff like ""thanks to our patented YumCoffeeTM method, we guarantee no bitterness in your coffee"". Ok I paraphrase, but it was kind of ridiculous that there's any technology in a glass beaker that holds something a bit higher than another thing. But I do love it and use it every day, so something works",Sanathy,Revisado en Reino Unido el 4 de julio de 2017
"Easy to use, easy to clean.","5,0 de 5 estrellas","If you're looking for a minimalistic experience, buy it.",Anaconda,Revisado en Alemania el 6 de agosto de 2022
The hype is real,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The biggest thing you will notice is less bitter, smoother coffee. For this reason alone I give it 5 stars. It’s also an attractive design, that is a beauty Queen compared to most other coffee brewing alternatives. They make a much more pricey version that is hand blown. If cost is an issue to you, like it is for me, then I highly recommend just getting this less expensive model. While I haven’t seen the hand blown one in person I can tell you this one does not look or feel cheap at all.

Ok so what is not to like, or what might make this not for you? 1. It requires you to buy filters. I love alternatives like French press or gold basket style drip coffee that let you avoid using single use paper products. Chemex branded filters are also a little pricey. 2. It’s large and can be relatively hard to clean. Ok so if swirling hot soapy water around is a good enough clean for you then this doesn’t apply. For me I notice a stale old coffee flavor if I don’t clean coffee pots well. I’m ok with quick rinses day to day but after three or four brews I really need to thoroughly clean any coffee pot back to squeaky clean. This flask is so large with such a narrow neck that you need a special angled scrub brusk to clean it by hand or a stabilizing clamp to hold it steady in a dish washer. 3. The coffee is not as hot temperature wise as most other brewing methods. While it is designed such that you can heat it on the stove, if you either can’t do this (for instance people with induction cook tops) or if you don’t want to do this (can result in scorched coffee or development of off flavors if done too hot or too long) then the coffee comes out just barely qualifying as hot. If you add a lot of cold milk or milk alternative then the coffee can be downright tepid. I like my coffee on the cooler side so it’s a bonus for me. My wife won’t drink coffee that’s anything less than piping hot so I have to microwave hers after adding the creamer. 4. The handle is jankey. Ok the wood and leather makes this look pretty but it’s really a nuisance to have to tie and untie those two wood pieces every time you clean the chemex. I’ve gotten to the point that I usually just skip it and use my oven glove to pour. 5. Storage could be an issue. This is large and awkwardly shaped. It’s not bottom heavy and it’s relatively light weight. All of these things result in a flask that’s easy to knock over and possibly difficult to find a place to safely store it. Ok so none of these are huge issues, but you should be aware that there are downsides. Compared to the drip and French press systems we had been using this thing is a clear win in terms of coffee flavor.

Ok so if you do buy this, here is what I’ve found to be a good method to brew coffee with a chemex: 1. Place filter in chemex with the thick part towards the part of the flask with the groove in it. 2 wet the filter with a little of your boiling water and then pour the water out through the groove. 3. Add 30 grams (~1oz) of fresh ground coffee to your wet filter, medium to medium fine grind 4. Pour just enough boiling water over the grounds to wet them, and wait 30secs for them to develop/bloom 5. Pour 2 cups (475 mL) of boiling water slowly over the grounds. 6. Let all the water drain through, discard the filter and grounds, and enjoy. NOTE: sometimes air gets trapped in the chemex when brewing and the water doesn’t drip through efficiently. If your brew stalls out like this, just grab the edges of the filter and give it a slight lift. This will release the air lock and get the coffee flowing again. Some people recommend putting a straw under the filter at the groove to prevent this from happening but that is totally unnecessary and needlessly complicated things.

Enjoy your coffee!",James Carter,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de junio de 2021
