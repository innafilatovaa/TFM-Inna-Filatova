"Muy fragil, y el filtro da lugar a duda","3,0 de 5 estrellas","Me ha gustado, el filtro es de metal, pero la jarra es muy delgada, se nota fragil.
Es facil de limpiar, pero mucho cuidado con no romperla.

Very solid pour over system,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","First of all, you can make great coffee with The Coffee Gator. If you're new to pour over, maybe don't use their suggested grounds:water ratio but that's not the hardware's fault.

By adjusting grind size this works for anything from 1 6oz cup to coffee for 4 people. That capacity is nice (and a bit unusual) for pour overs.

Its shape also does a decent job of collecting most of the unfiltered sediment along with a splash of liquid before it pours into your cups. The spout does tend to dribble a bit at the end if you're a neat freak.

The reason this isn't a 5 star review is because a glass carafe/micro-filter system can't be 5 stars. The glass, while seemingly very sturdy in my month of using it, is still glass. And a micro-filter mesh will always have 2 drawbacks:

1. It will never filter out all of the sediment from your coffee

2. It can be easy to damage if you aren't careful with cleaning and storing it

That said, I would definitely give this 4.5 stars. Come on, half star ratings! What are we even doing here?",Erik Pratt,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de julio de 2024

just a tad small,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","good product but the volume is a bit low. also it helps to also put in paper filters inside the mesh so it is easier to clean and it gets a stronger brew.

part of it is that the overall size under teh filter isn't a half gallon, but also you have to monitor the water/coffee driping through. the funnel part will overflow if you try to put the servable amount in the top all at once.",leny bob,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de junio de 2024

"Makes awesome coffee, but fragile.","3,0 de 5 estrellas","If you're looking for a convenient, great tasting, cost effective solution, to drastically reduce your coffee expenses, the coffee gator pour over carafe is great. However, the carafe is extremely fragile. If you take extreme care by allowing the carafe to cool down, and hand washing separately from other dishes, it is highly likely that you'll get spider cracks around the rim early with use, like I did. No issues with the basket though. If I purchase another one, I may experiment with rinsing only.",call_tyrone21,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de junio de 2024

Nice pour iver set,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this for my wife for Xmas. We have had filter machines, French presses, espresso machines etc etc and it was time to try a pour over. This thing is so easy to use and is great quality . At first I felt like the glass was so thin and going to break but I believe it is some kind of special silicate glass, more skin to chemistry grade glass than tumbler or drinking glass glass.
I had a small issue with the filter recently and I contacted the retailer who replied to me within a few hours and I will be receiving a complete replacement next week!
It‚Äôs rare these days that you deal with a company who stands by their products and this is a testament to their customer service.
The brand is Coffee Gator and the company is called Nestopia. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy one if their products again. Top marks!
I have been using this product daily since Xmas and it has been washed every day and sometimes treated a little harder than it maybe should have been. Part of the filter came away where it was spot welded. I don‚Äôt like using paper filters.
Overall 5 stars for the pour over set and 5 stars for the customer service üëå",donald webb,Revisado en Reino Unido el 2 de junio de 2024

Excellent coffee but brittle carafe,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Like the title says, the coffee is consistently good. The mesh is easy to clean and very convenient.

Making the carafe slightly more break resistant would make it a perfect product.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de mayo de 2024
Cool take on the pour over carafe,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've always wanted a pour over carafe but couldn't justify the expense so I never bought one. However, as I'm delving into the world of making tinctures and bitters, this product seemed to be the best to use for straining the plant matter from the alcohol.

But before I used it for that purpose, I thought I'd try it for coffee. I love it! It's so much easier to clean up than the french press and no more dealing with grounds that always seem to get past the press mesh. I especially love the handy measurements on the size so I know how much coffee I'm making. I know it's going to work great for my adventures in infusing plants into various media.

And a huge shout out to their customer service team!!! I had a small defect in my carafe and they quickly and professionally addressed the issue.",Tanya Brooks,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de mayo de 2024

Ein Fazit nach 4 Jahren Einsatz - top,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Kurzfassung: Haltbarkeit, M√∂glichkeit zur Reinigung und Nachhaltigkeit sehr gut vereint. Das Set h√§lt auch nach 4,5 Jahren quasi t√§glichem Dauereinsatz noch alles, was zum Verkaufszeitpunkt versprochen wurde.
W√ºrde ich, im Falle eines Bruchs des Glases oder sonstiges sofort wieder bestellen.

Zubereitung: Funktioniert einwandfrei, das Sieb ist fein genug um die meisten Kaffeepartikel abzuhalten, grob genug um einen guten Fluss zu erm√∂glichen. Ich sehe hier kein Nachteil gegen√ºber einem Pour Over welcher mit Papierfiltern arbeitet. Mit angepassten Mahlgrad lassen sich auch gut 600-650ml auf einmal zubereiten, mehr ginge vermutlich auch, dann dauert die Durchlaufzeit jedoch zu lange.

Reinigung: Das t√§gliche Reinigen ist extrem einfach, gutes Absp√ºlen des Filters und der Kanne gen√ºgt (alle 2-3 Tage wandert dieses zus√§tzlich in die Sp√ºlmaschine). Den Filter legen wir alle 2-3 Wochen in eine leicht dosiertes Wasserbad mit Cafiza Kaffeefettl√∂ser ein - danach gut reinigen und er ist wie neu.

Haltbarkeit: Die Kanne h√§lt erstaunlich viel aus, Wechsel von hei√üen zu kalten Wasser, Br√ºhen auf Eisw√ºrfel, leichte St√∂√üe. Nach 4,5 Jahren sieht man ihr kaum ihre t√§gliche Nutzung an.

Verschlimmbessert bis zur Unbenutzbarkeit,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Ich hatte die Vorg√§ngerversion des Siebs, das mir leider jemand im Campingurlaub mit irgendwas durchl√∂chert hat.
Da ich sowieso ein neues Sieb bestellen musste, habe ich mich f√ºr das bew√§hrte Coffee Gator Sieb entschieden und da es das nicht mehr einzeln gab, eben in dieser Variante mit Glaskanne.

Die Kanne selbst ist gut gearbeitet, ist aber eher schwierig zu reinigen.
Sie besteht aus einfachem Glas, wird schnell hei√ü und der Inhalt schnell wieder kalt - daf√ºr ist sie nicht sehr schwer. F√ºr Vieltrinker oder Menschen die Kaffee ma√ügeblich f√ºr Besuch auftischen gut geeignet. Im Homeoffice gibts √∂fters kalten Kaffee.

Richtig schlimm ist aber das Sieb
Die neue Version des Siebs ist bez√ºglich der Funktionalit√§t eine Verbesserung zum Original. Durch die zus√§tzlichen L√∂cher am Boden l√§uft der Kaffee auch bei mittlerem Mahlgrad besser ab und verstopft nicht mehr beim Br√ºhvorgang.
Das bringt aber nicht viel, da die Verklebung (?) des Feinsiebs sich l√∂st. Dadurch sammelt sich Kaffeepulver zwischen Feinsieb und Trichtersieb. Das wird mit der Zeit eklig und l√§sst sich dann auch nicht mehr reinigen. Zus√§tzlich l√§uft das Wasser dann auch gerne mal an der Seite ab anstatt durch den Kaffee zu laufen.

Kleines zus√§tzliches Manko: Wenn man gerne ordentlichen Kaffee trinkt (64g auf 1L) ist es schwierig keine Sauerei zu machen, denn sobald man das Sieb zu mehr als 3/4 mit Wasser f√ºllt, l√§uft der Kaffee an der Ausgie√ü√∂ffnung der Kanne heraus...

I am by no means a coffee expert in flavor or technique reviewing quality. The stainless reusable / permanent filter is really great but I still use a paper towel to empty the strainer to remove the grinds ( do not have option to simply rinse out) . The main issue is the glass carafe it has worked fine I am careful with it the idea this is packable is a stretch . The glass is simple not thick enough.

Lovely little coffee maker!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I am a college student, but I usually only drink one cup of coffee a day. So, while looking for a new coffee maker, I wasn't looking for anything too big, especially as I share my small dorm kitchen with my two roommates. I was also interested in experimenting with manual coffee makers; one of my roommates last year had had a Keurig she let me use, but I wasn't too impressed with the results, so I knew I did not want to invest in a pod brewer for myself.

The CoffeeGator pour-over hit the nail on the head. It delivers on all fronts: compact size, sleek design, fairly priced, easy to use, relatively speedy (compared to the average French press), fun to experiment with, and most importantly, a delicious brew. I have never enjoyed drinking coffee black in the past, but now I do at least a few times a week and really enjoy it. I usually use a #2 cone-shaped coffee filter just to make cleanup faster, although going filter-less definitely works, too, and cleanup doesn't take that much effort.

I was going to leave a review when I first bought it back in July, but I kept forgetting to. Yesterday, however, I accidentally dropped the carafe and the top half shattered. I had noticed other Amazon reviews mentioning that CoffeeGator had replaced their brewers for various reasons, so I thought I may as well try to contact them before buying a replacement. I emailed them last night explaining the situation (with a screenshot of my Amazon order) and a little over 12 hours later, they have already graciously responded and shipped out a replacement! I was willing to buy one of their replacement carafes (which isn't as expensive as buying the whole kit again) but was relieved and impressed by their customer service, especially being on a college student's limited budget. Kudos, CoffeeGator!",Sarah,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de noviembre de 2018
"LOVE,LOVE my Coffee Gator Pour over pot and kettle","5,0 de 5 estrellas","If you love good, smooth coffee you HAVE to get a Coffee Gator pour over pot and kettle! A friend told me about it a few months ago, but I couldn't imagine better coffee pot better than Keurig coffee. I was watching Amazon daily deals one day a couple of weeks ago, and this pot was on special, so, I ordered it and received it two days later. I think I was weaned on coffee when very young, so, LOVE LOVE coffee!! And LOVE, LOVE MY COFFEE GATOR POUR-OVER POT! I remember as a child, my mother dripping coffee, and I still have her drip pot, but it requires a filter and much more difficult. She would boil water (big mistake)and pour over the coffee, etc. All drip pots aren't created equally.
I tried a few days making my coffee in my new pot, heating my water in the microwave, then using my thermometer to check the temp. That was such pain and took too much time. SO, I ordered the 1.2L gooseneck kettle with built-in thermometer.. WOW! What a difference it has made! I like quick and have used Keurig for 7 years, but to me, this doesn't really take any more time. I fill my kettle the night before with filtered water, then as soon as I go into my kitchen, I turn the burner on while starting my husband's Keurig. It might take 1 min more, but SO worth it. My husband isn't the coffee snob that I am, so he still gets Keurig. üòä It took a while to get the perfect water to coffee ratio, but I have it now. I used to set my Keurig on small setting, approx 6oz. Now, I make a full coffee gator and it fills my big cup perfectly. I am using a New Orleans coffee bean and grind my beans at home. This coffee is sold in grocery stores and it's wonderful but I will go to a local roaster and buy their very freshly roasted beans, which will make even better coffee. I know this is long, but I wanted to cover everything.. oh, almost forgot to mention Coffee Gator's customer service. Awesome, they want their customers to be totally satisfied. They were great even before I bought my pot, answering any questions and helping make the best coffee decision I could make, but truly amazing after the sale, sending hints on making the best coffee. They don't want even one dissatisfied customer. I HIGHLY recommend this loud over pot AND kettle. Now, I'm looking forward to buying the canister to store my beans.",RT Davis,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de agosto de 2017
This product changed my coffee life!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Like most people, I used to either head to the nearest Starbucks or brew my own in my Keurig at home. Starbucks is an expensive option, and as convenient as K-Cups are, the coffee comes out just a little too watered out and light for my taste. The coffee gator pour over coffee maker is perfect. It makes a perfect, rich deep coffee brew that just can't compare to anything else. During the summer, I double the coffee grinds, add ice to the carafe and make the perfect iced coffee. Since I bought this over a year ago, I haven't spent the $5 (or more!) on a Starbucks coffee and I can count on one hand how many times I've used my Keurig. The pour over method enhances and preserves the natural oils and flavoring that you can't get any other way if you want that deep rich coffee flavor. I know, I sound like an advertisement, but seriously it's so good. And for all you short-on-time people - with grinding my own coffee from whole beans, and using an electric kettle for fast water heating, my coffee is ready in less than 5 minutes. Believe me, the extra 4 minutes it takes over a K-Cup is worth every second. And if you just don't have the time for that in the morning, you can brew your coffee the night before and put the carafe in the fridge so your iced coffee is all ready to go in the morning. By the way, Coffee Gator has awesome customer service too. I had a small issue with the second larger carafe I bought from them - they completely stood behind their product and I had a brand new one in very short order. If I ever do need to order another one, I can tell you that I'll be coming straight back to this company to buy it again. Great price and quality and above and beyond excellent customer service. If you want coffee house coffee for a fraction of the cost - this coffee maker is what you want!",CJ,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de junio de 2017
"Coffee so good, it will ruin you.","5,0 de 5 estrellas","My how the tables have come full circle and turned upside down.

I started my love affair with coffee at a young age, addicted the the auto drip coffee. As I grew I became less enamored with it, but I still called her every week. Then things changed on the Honeymoon with my Wife. We stayed a fancy hotel and Coffee, well she was served as a french press. Oh those seductive notes, the rich taste, she lulled me back to her again.

As soon as I got home I got a French Press and never looked back. Now it is 10 years later. Sometimes I give in and get coffee from the coffee machine, but I love the french press still. I started drinking Blonde roast about 2 years ago. I was reading and someone mentioned that blonde roast is better as a pour over. My coworker also parroted that pour over is the best coffee.

Pour over? What the heck is that? French press all the way baby that's all there is to it. Most people see Pour over as a uniquely Hipster thing. A level of coffee snobbery I have left un-attained. And yet... I ordered this on curiosity. I reviewed a bunch of options, and decided that I didn't want to go back to using filters, so metal mesh is fine for me. This seemed to be the best between aesthetics, build quality, and reviews.

My first pot of this was Andaqui 100% Colombian, my second Blond roast from Starbucks... I wonder now if I ever truly tasted coffee before. I told my wife that I fear for my immortal soul by throwing in with the Hipster. She said we can't be friends anymore, she jests, but I thought... ""I'm not sure I can go back to normal coffee now"". This tasted so good I just about slapped your mama thinking about it.

If there is a fault with this product, I would hazard to say I would like more capacity because I am a coffee sharer. I love sharing the experience and I will drink this whole pot by myself as it pours about 1 normal cup for me. Would I purchase again? Yes Yes and a million times Yes. French press... whats her number again? I forget... Anyone want a french press?",Rarzilla,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de mayo de 2016
"A high-quality product, and a company that stands behind it with stellar service!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a high-quality product that makes excellent coffee. But even more importantly, Coffee Gator's customer service is absolutely stellar!!

I bought this coffee maker almost exactly one year ago, and have used it daily since I received it. The materials are solid. It is easy to use. It makes delicious coffee! The filter traps virtually all of the unpleasant sediment, leaving mere traces at the bottom, subtle enough to drink without any problem.

All was good until recently when the water began dripping through the filter so slowly that it became painful to use. I tried boiling the filter in a large pot with water and distilled vinegar, and allowed it to then soak overnight. Then, I cleaned it using warm soapy water and a soft dishcloth - as I always do. It improved the flow somewhat, but not enough to make it useable - still too slow. I have consistently tried to take good care of the filter, to keep it operating well, and I don't know what I might have done differently to avoid the clogging problem.

I contacted Coffee Gator by email, and I received a very prompt and courteous reply from Viktoria. She asked me to send a photo of the filter, provide my order number, and describe my cleaning practices. I did as she asked, and she generously offered to send me a new filter free of charge!

Unfortunately, she and her team did not have any suggestions about how I might change my usage practices to avoid future clogging, and it seems to me that a filter of this construction should not become so clogged after just one year, and with the care that I have given it. But how can one complain much when confronted with such kind and generous customer support?

Thank you, Viktoria and Coffee Gator! I continue to be a loyal Coffee Gator customer.",B. Reid,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de noviembre de 2017
Not a bad system but could use a few quality upgrades,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I would really love to give this more stars but I guess I take my ratings system a little more serious than everyone thinking everything is 5 stars. To me, 5 stars is given when its A) clearly the best product in that market segment or B) when it far exceeds expectations for the price.

While the Coffee Gator does make a great cup of coffee and while it does the job, it's no better than some of the other options out there. I guess what I'm disappointed in that Coffee Gator didn't decide to make a $40 product to compete with the $40 Chemex, and sell it on the no filters alone. I think and extra $4-5 in product costs would have gone a long way in making Coffee Gator the best pour over system in the market.

Pros: Pretty good system for the money. Good size. Good price. Don't need to replace the filters.

Cons: Made in China (almost a given) Thin glass (I doubt this will make a year with granite counters/etc). Poorly defined pouring spout makes spills more common. Cheaply made filter. They could have invested a few more bucks for thicker metal and better welding process.

Overall it's not a bad system and I'm happy with what it does. But I just feel that for a few bucks more they could have thicker glass to make it more durable (I know, more breaks equal more sales) and a better quality filter would make this a 5 star product and still fit in the $40 price range.",Old Mother Hubbard,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de diciembre de 2016
Easy to use and coffee tastes good.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Improved taste of supermarket coffee. This is the Shop Rite brand and it does taste much better using the Coffee Gator. My daily coffee is by Death Wish and there is also a slight improvement but I have not finalized my ratio of water to coffee yet. Hence, I expect an improvement once I settle on my recipe.

I also like that this is easy to clean and don't have to use coffee filter and the associated mess.

OK, bottom line is that I really like the Coffee Gator and it looks good.

Why only 4 stars? On my Coffee Gator the graduations on the vessel seem to be inaccurate. The company told me they consider a cup of coffee to be 11 ounces of water as do other companies. Some companies consider 6 ounces of water to be a cup of coffee. What ever.

However I felt that the graduations were wrong. Using a Paterson graduated beaker that is about 3.5"" in diameter showed the following discrepancies.

CG = Coffee Gator vs. Paterson beaker made in England with graduations for US and English fluid ounces and also Milliliters.

CG 4 cups indicated is 19.5 US fluid ounces; a little over 20 English ounces and 575 ml.

800 ml indicated is really 875 ml.

400 ml indicated is really 485 ml.

None of the above is important unless you are trying to follow a predetermined ratio.",R. Stern,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de febrero de 2018
Great Coffee Anytime and Every Time!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this Coffee Gator and it suits my needs perfectly. It's perfect for making a nice big cup of delicious steaming hot aromatic (LaVazza) go-juice in the morning without having to make a whole large pot. It rinses out quickly and I can make a second cup in minutes if I want to, and I think i do. The stainless steel strainer works perfectly and I don't have to mess with paper filters ever AGAIN! The icing on the cake is it produces a fantastically smooth and delicious tasting cup of coffee. I like it so much I have already purchased another one and have one in green and one in black. Note that it is small and is basically a single serve pour over coffee maker. It will make one large cup of coffee or two small to medium cups. I'm usually just making coffee for myself in the early morning and so it was just what I was looking for. Got company? No problem, it only takes minutes to make more or as in my case I can get both Gators going at once. You'll need a kettle to heat the filtered water for the 'pour over' but the Gator makes one of those too if you ain't got one. I also use a Sovrano manual crank coffee bean grinder for making freshly ground coffee for the Gator, and my whole beans are kept fresh in a Gator coffee canister.

Quick Drip,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","See below for my original comment: Coffee Gator saw the below and promptly provided me with some feedback on how to better use the product in addition to sending me a replacement filter. I do feel that my concern is user error and I am hoping that the ebook that they are sending me on the use of the product will be helpful. I look forward to reviewing it and hopefully getting some tips on the grind size etc. All in all I have still enjoyed using the product and find it super easy. It's a better concept than the press and so much easier to clean and discard the grinds. You can even use the filter over a mug if you wish. My original comment is below:
Perhaps I am doing something incorrect, however, I find that the mesh filter does not marinate with the grinds long enough and flows through.
I ended up filtering the coffee through several passes. Yes, I have changed the grind but all in all it flows way to quickly. I have taken a piece of aluminum foil and covered the bottom to slow the drip process and that helps some. Other than that it's great. If anyone has any tips I'd love them because I do like the concept.",Darin Wright,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de enero de 2018
"If you're debating pour over, DO IT!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a great product. I always wanted to try pour over coffee but thought it was a huge commitment time wise. I was tired of the cheap, bitter taste the Keurig lent to any coffee brewed through it but loved the ease of it. I broke down and bought this (after seeing coffee shop prices upwards of $70 for similar products). I like that there are no disposable filter with this, one less thing to worry about. I followed the instructions and had my first cup in no time. I was really surprised at how non-time consuming this product was. The coffee was fantastic (I use beans from Coffee Emporium here in Cincinnati, they roast there own, not over roast like Starbucks)! Clean up was a breeze. I did realize really quickly that you MUST have a pour over kettle, otherwise you have hot water everywhere. The only thing I would change on this is the inner filter. It should be tacked down at the seam somehow (spot welded or something). When you clean out the grounds, be careful not to run your finger around the inside or make sure you go the same direction as the seam lays. The filter is delicate, if you go the wrong direction you will cause the seam to bend upward. I tried to flatten it back out to no avail. Hard to get a few grounds out now that it's flipped up. That's not a deal breaker though, it's still worthy of five stars.",L. Arnold,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de octubre de 2016
"Great filter, vulnerable carafe. (01/03/2019 update)","3,0 de 5 estrellas","Update 11/20/2019: It's been around 10 months since I updated my review, and during those months I've probably used my pour over for about 4-5 of those months at work for 1-2 pots a day. I'm sad to say that now instead of having an issue with the Carafe, it's the filter now. The thinner strainer film has come loose from the bottom of the filter. Second one this has happened to now, the first one happened within a month or so of getting the replacement filter. Maybe I've been cleaning it wrong, and as a result, have been damaging it on my own. However I think I've now proven to myself that I'll either need a silicone, plastic, or paper one. I just can't have nice things. :]

Update 01/03/2019: Fantastic customer service. I was contacted Christmas Eve of last year by the company's founder, wanting to know how he could make it right. Within a week, I had a replacement WHOLE CARAFE WITH FILTER sent to my house at no charge. I will absolutely be continuing to purchase products from Coffee Gator!

First, I love this pour over. Great tasting coffee, every time. My sticking point is the carafe is less durable than wet tissue paper. I was washing the inside of it out with a brush and noticed that my brush was sticking through the bottom of the carafe. Might not have noticed it was broken if not for that. No noise, no shatter. Just a broken carafe and a broken heart. If you want a nice pour over filter for a similar size and shape carafe, get this one, but due to the fragility of this carafe I can‚Äôt recommend this.",Andrew Barton,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de diciembre de 2018
"Seriously handy, seriously tasty!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","Is this as good as most folks suggest or prefer to believe? Actually, yes. Does it turn humble roasted coffee beans into ""nectar of the gods""? Well, when you're used to a French press, you won't notice a significant difference in taste, per-say - though if you're looking for a ""lighter brew"" (less oils), this will produce a tendency to the lighter side (the water and the coffee simply aren't in contact for the same amount of time!), however... the one HUGE difference you'll become aware of the first time you use it, is CLEAN UP! French press: Why did we insist on ""inventing"" a new, electric ""drip"" appliance, when we already had a ""perfect"" coffee maker?? Clean up? May explain the trend away from the press...
""Pour Over"" coffee maker: Wow, that does a good job! I guess we should clean this so that it's ready for round two... What? What do you mean it's done already? Seriously, 1 minute and some running water, and this diddy is good to go - yes... It's that easy!
Do I wish it were half again larger? Sure, but it makes a 20 oz mug of coffee with no problems, so it's not ""too small"" by any means.
Do I wish I'd tried one before now? Yes sir, I do :) Bloody nice coffee maker, with a well thought out design, and a surprising number of ""useful"" features (I'll let you discover these for yourself, as that's half the fun!).",Caleb Wear,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de mayo de 2017

They do not sell separately but gave me 50% off my 2 order. Yesterday while washing the carafe it lightly bumped the sink and shattered. I have not had it a month. I am not happy.

Overall, I'd say this product is just pretty good. The coffee tastes great, but the carafe is hard to clean. I had to get a special bottle cleaner to get in there. The filter works pretty well, lots of coffee dust in the bottom of my cup, though. I have to wait for it to settle before drinking my coffee. The little rubber grip on the filter came off, and Coffee Gator customer service was not helpful. They would not stand behind their product, and refused to replace the filter for me. They just sent me a coupon for a discount (and not a very good one) on a replacement. Not even an apology. I'm not impressed on that front.

"Easy to use, and easy to clean!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","Excellent coffee maker! I love the comfortable handle. The carafe and stainless steel filter is really easy to clean.

Do yourself a favor, make sure your coffee is consistent from batch to batch by using a thermometer to make sure your water is in the correct temperature range. Better yet, use a kettle that has a built-in thermometer, like the one I use: Stainless Steel Gooseneck Stovetop Pour Over Coffee Kettle with Thermometer by Kitchables . Since getting the water temp sorted out, every batch I make has been very, very consistent.

Listen, some people focus too much on measuring out the beans to the gram and measuring out every drippety drop of water to the gram‚Äîto heck with all that. Just buy great coffee that's not been over roasted, grind it evenly, and make sure your water is at the right temperature. Pour the water over the coffee using whatever system you prefer (pour over, aeropress, drip machine, whatever), and voila great coffee. Easy peasy. This isn't rocket science. Higher coffee to water ratio, stronger coffee; lower coffee to water ratio, milder coffee. If you get it too strong, add a touch of water (or dairy product of your choice) to the brewed coffee. Too mild? Add ice and enjoy it cold, not a big deal. Just have fun with it. :)",Ken Wallace,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de noviembre de 2016
"Easy, fast, bold coffee!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I was looking for something that would help my coffee taste less watered down than my Keurig, but also be easy and fast to make. This Gator Pour Over is the solution. I am in full control over how strong/bold my coffee comes out. It's a couple extra steps than just popping a k-cup in a device, BUT the flavor/taste you get is so much more rewarding. It actually gets fun and becomes 2nd nature after a few tries. I boil water hot water in a kettle, while that is heating up, I rinse out the Gator and included filter with hot water from the sink. I then add my my coffee grounds to the filter, and give my filter a quick shake to level out the grounds. By the time that is all done, my water has heated up enough in the kettle to start pouring over the grounds. Within seconds the water has seeped through the filter and the measuring icons on the Gator help me get just the right amount of coffee. And creamer, and bam - bye Starbucks.

I read a previous review which suggested one tbsp scoop per cup as labeled on the carafe, which is good rule of thumb, and I prepare ""3"" which fills my large mug, a single cup. I am not sure if other brands/makes have a larger neck to fit hand in for cleaning; this is too narrow. I give a good rinse, and also have swooshed with soapy water. As I keep an electric hot water kettle handy for tea, this is extremely easy to use, just as quick or quicker than my drip. It also looks and feels a little more discerning than drip maker ! (update two months later: I love this pour-over! the coffee is great and my guests all compliment the flavor. I have started to clean it with a dish soap wand and that works perfectly.)",particular shopper,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de septiembre de 2017
Back to basics for a good brew,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been using k cups with a huge coffee maker that really took up too much counter space in our kitchen. The coffee it made kind of awful too, real ashy and generic. And there really wasn't much difference between one box of cups or another. I kept asking myself whats the point? The time saved is really negligible. And I REALLY didn't need another machine/device/whatever in my life blinking at me and telling me to ""add more water please"". You know, like ""Feed me Seymour."" They call that a ""feature"". Whatever, it sucked. This pour over brought me back to the basic, contemplative joy of making a good cup of coffee in the morning. If this sounds a bit ritualistic I guess it is. BUT I'll wager its a morning ritual for all coffee drinkers on some level or another so why not enjoy it?

Now if the bean is supposed to be fruity, dark roasted, nutty or whatever I can taste it. With this coffee maker I've stopped treating the brew as medicine and more as an opportunity to relax and read the paper in the morning.",Two Tents,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de abril de 2017
Awesome Pour Over,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","The hubs and I have loved our coffee gator pour over. I purchased it as a gift for my husband last Christmas and it got a ton of use. I was so sad when I accidentally knocked the base of it on the edge of the sink while it was freshly hot and it broke. I will likely be ordering a replacement pitcher soon, though I have considered ordering the whole set again. The filter that came with ours is definitely showing wear. The seam on the interior is coming away. It's still usable, but I also think it's gotten some calcium build up from so much heavy use; the water doesn't filter through as quickly now. The little rubber piece on the handle of the filter has also come loose and will slide off. If not for the filter wearing out, I would've given this 5 stars. We've made some awesome coffee with this bad boy. Pour over has become our preferred way of brewing at home. This set was affordable and gave us exactly what we were looking for.",mmporter,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de noviembre de 2017
Great on all levels except durability :( but customer service is 10/10,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","So I really liked this coffee maker as far as function goes 10/10 changed coffee making for me entirely went from a French press to this and the quality of the coffee this brews far exceeds anything I ever brewed in my French press.

One gripe while it was great I was cleaning this and dropped it maybe 4 inches into the sink and it broke a huge chunk out of the top.

I only put 3 stars because I only used it for maybe a few weeks before it broke really unfortunate and disappointing

That is the only issue I had but unfortunately it broke way to quick and now I‚Äôm in search of a more durable pour over.

Update: Coffee Gator reached out to me and offered me a 50% off coupon for a new unit hopefully this one lasts longer but regardless 5star worthy customer service",Nat3rT4ter,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de mayo de 2021
Makes a perfect cup!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've always been very intrigued about pour over coffee, but it seemed a little complicated. I know there are a lot of fancy pour over carafes available, but my Coffee Gator carafe makes a perfect cup every time. I don't need to make a lot of coffee. Just one cup tasty cup is enough for me. The Coffee Gator is very easy to use and to clean. I wanted something that did not require paper filters, and the Coffee Gator stainless steel mesh filter does a great job at keeping the grounds out of my cup. Be sure to start with freshly roasted high quality beans and a good burr grinder. I use a somewhat fine grind (not as fine as espresso). Also, be sure to use filtered water and heat it to 205 degrees. A gooseneck kettle is very helpful for pour over, and Coffee Gator make a very good, affordable one. The Coffee Gator brews the coffee nice and slow, allowing for a bloom and efficient extraction. The coffee temperature is just perfect when it's done. I LOVE IT!",Tellen,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de marzo de 2020
UPDATED - reusable filter broke,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Overall very happy with our glass pour over, however the glass is pretty delicate and I feel nervous every time I set it on the tile countertop. I'm used to my durable Pyrex and this is definitely not that quality. That being said, so far so good. (It has been one month so far). Love the double mesh stainless filter!

Update: well the reusable coffee filter did not pass the test of time. The metal filter is cheaply riveted to the ring top (that has the lifting tab) and it broke right off. Disappointed after less than 2/3 of a year of use. To me, the point of embracing reusable product is to minimize disposable waste but when a product is made cheaply, it's the worst kind of disposable.

Another update: Coffee Gator was kind enough to replace the broken filter. They have great customer service, but I still would have preferred that it didn't break so quickly in the first place. Hopefully this one will last longer.",Mama,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de agosto de 2017
Very good coffee maker but the glass is too thin,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This product makes a great cup of coffee, plus it's easy to use and cleanup is a breeze. You'll probably want one with a bigger carafe if you drink more than one large cup of coffee at a time, but this is the perfect size for me. My only complaint is durability -- considering this is a product you'll use every day, the glass is definitely too thin. Even though I handle it with care, it's not a question of IF the carafe will break but WHEN it will break. So far so good after ~5 months but I'm sure I'll have to buy a replacement eventually. Also, I would have liked it to come with a utensil for easily scraping the grounds into the trash. I mean, a spoon works OK but it would have been nice to include some type of more ideally-shaped tool. Just a suggestion for the manufacturer. Overall I'm happy with the product.",Adam,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de septiembre de 2017
"Wie erwartet, sehr gut!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","Die Zustellung erfolgte Dank Prime blitzschnell.
Der Kaffeebr√ºher war sicher verpackt und wurde unbesch√§digt angeliefert.
Die Verpackung ist wie immer bei Coffee Gator ziemlich cool und fast sch√∂ner

Der Kaffeebr√ºher sieht, wie ich finde, ziemlich cool aus und macht bei Besuch +
Br√ºhen vor Zuschauern echt was her.
Die Verarbeitung ist sehr gut, das Glas erscheint sehr d√ºnn und zerbrechlich, ist
jedoch bemerkenswert robust (sch√∂n mehrmals irgendwo angesto√üen, etc.)
Der Edelstahlfilter macht was er soll und zwar sehr gut.
Die Reinigung ist zwar immer ein wenig Sauerei aber an sich schnell und einfach.
Anzumerken ist allein, dass aufgrund der Mehrschichtigkeit die Reinigung am oberen
Filterrand ein wenig schwer f√§llt und ein paar kleine R√ºckst√§nde nicht ohne weiteres
wegbekommen sind, ohne den Filter zu arg zu schrubben + ggf. zu besch√§digen.
F√ºr mich jedoch kein Grund f√ºr Punktabzug - daf√ºr funktioniert er leider zu gut!
Wer hochwertigen Kaffee verarbeitet oder einfach nur aus seinem Lidl-Kaffee alles was

Yum! Makes the best coffee!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this pour over coffee maker when I decided to start making coffee by the pour over method. I have been using a French Press for several years and love my coffee that way. But the pour over method called to me so I decided to try it. I perused the other brewers on the market and read reviews. One of the things that was important to me was not having to buy filters. A daily filter adds up in the trash pile! But I was concerned that without a filter I would get fine coffee grounds in my coffee- WELL. Not a speck! I love how it cleanly brews the coffee without a filter. :) It is the best! I will admit I am concerned that that glass will break and I am very careful. (I have broken 2 french presses) I think the perfect addition would be a little wooden or rubber plate type thing to set it on. Currently I am using the cardboard ""coaster"" like thing it came with. Other than that- Love it! And highly recommend!",Laurie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de enero de 2019
Does what it is supposed to do,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Does what it is supposed to do. I can tell it has the potential to brew really good coffee. But it is a learning curve and something to get used to as I have only ever had a machine to brew in the past. Otherwise, it's simple if you want a basic cup of coffee and I have enjoyed it so far.

It is completely glass. The center of it is made out of silicon. The mesh filter is really nice and seems of high quality. The product, in it's entirety is easy to clean. The pot says it holds 3 cups...that is true, I suppose, if you are making espresso shots. I fill the marker to 2 cups, and it really only fills up 3/4 (if even) of a standard sized mug.

This product does not produce a coffee smell. So if you like the smell of coffee when you are brewing, this is not the product for you.",Jacquelyn,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de agosto de 2016
You know that awful sound that your favorite mug makes on that day when you pick it ...,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","You know that awful sound that your favorite mug makes on that day when you pick it up by the handle and hear a grinding sound? Well, yesterday our pour over coffee maker made that sound when I picked it up. There was a fracture beginning where the bottom of the handle joins the carafe. Reading the reviews this seems to be a rare occurrence, as borosilicate glass is very tough.

One day after posting this review I was contacted by the manufacturer, who offered a refund or replacement. We're going for the replacement because we really like this coffee maker. We use it daily for coffee and we often make tea in it as well. If you're picky about your coffee like we are, this is a good choice. A word of advice: The stainless steel filter is slower than other types of filters, so watch your water temperature (180 deg) for the best results. But for tea you can safely pour boiling water directly into the carafe.

Five stars for a perfect cup of coffee and excellent customer service.",DPS,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de diciembre de 2017
Easy to clean- Great capacity - Pours nicely,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I had a simple plastic pour over for years and then a French press. This pour over style and carafe set is sleek and feels great in my hands. I am very tactile and didn‚Äôt like the process of cleaning the French press and I was hoping that this would help my problem. This is WAY easier to clean!!!!! Plus the additional benefit of being able to make more then one cup at a time just brings this product to ELEVEN! If I could change anything at all I think I‚Äôd try to design a removable silicone grip that could be fitted onto the bottom. This would help buffer any hard bumps in the sink and against other housewares that it may come in contact with, as well as help to insulate.

Just. Plain. Awesome.

Get it!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Love it. I lived in Colombia, and there I learned what a good cup of coffee is. Colombian coffee here is just like other coffees. But Colombian coffee in Colombia, amazing. 15 years and I can't get seem to find anything that compares. This comes pretty close! (OK, I visited this summer and brought home some fresh roasted beans from a friend's coffee ranch, which I used for my first batch, so, my experience might have been a little biased.) I've had to experiment around with temps and levels, but I'm getting closer. I'm just curious what would be the best grinding level. Espresso creates a mud, but it's nice and thick coffee, I just poured it through a couple of times. One tip I have is the numbers on the carafe equal the number of tablespoons. If I am going to fill the water to six, I put six rounded tablespoons. Go forth Gator makers! And use good coffee, why bother otherwise?

New edit...so sad, the carafe broke when I was hand washing it. It slipped and fell inside the sink, very delicate glass. But I still loved it!",Rachael,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de enero de 2017
Great product!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I was very pleased with this product. It looks and works great. The mesh filter that comes with it is high quality, easy to use and easy to clean. I have this product four stars in stead of five because I think it would be nice if it had a slightly different designe to it. Currently, the shape of my coffee gator makes it almost as heavy on top as it is on bottom, making it too easy to tip over and break. A slightly bulkier bottom half might help alleviate this problem.

Over all though, I‚Äôm very happy with this product. I would definitely recommend it. Also, I believe the smaller version does have a bulkier bottom, so that might be the best option for those who will only make a cup or two at a time.",KourtneyNM,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de mayo de 2019
Just Right!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Works really well for my needs. It makes enough for me to have a cup of coffee while getting ready for work as well as a 20 oz travel mug for the commute. The carafe doesn't insulate all that well so as soon as I make it I pour it into my cup and the rest goes into the insulated travel mug. The filter is fantastic! It works just right and cleans easily with hot water. I clean it immediately after each use and haven't had any issues whatsoever. Perhaps best of all is that I was able to discard my electric drip coffee maker, which gave me some much needed extra counter space. Finally, I have found that i go through less coffee because I make the exact amount I need each day. Seems like I was wasting a lot of coffee with the automatic drip machine.

"Simple, delicious, awesome!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","First off, I ordered the ""green"" version because it was like, $2 less. To my delight, green is actually a lovely shade of teal!
It's so easy to make my essential morning coffee. I set water to boil, add a few scoops of coffee grounds to the filter, take my now boiling water off the stove, walk away while I wrestle my 5 year old, come back, pour a little water on my coffee grounds (it's called blooming?!), play turn or two of words with friends, then pour the rest of the water into the filter. Once it's done dripping, I pour it into my mug, add a drop of maple syrup (yum!) and start my day! Best coffee ever.
Oh! And easy to clean. I run water through the filter holding the filter upside down. This prevents the tiny grounds from getting stuck anywhere. When the caraffe has cooled, I give it a rinse. Air dry.

A fine brewing system!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I am a coffee maker nut and wanted to add this style Brewer to my collection. The unit is as described. I made a batch with it and was very happy with the flavor using this method. However I wasn't overjoyed to find out how many grounds are required to make just 8 cups. If you are like me and use only premium whole beans, this method will definitely cost a bit extra as far as beans go. I would however recommend the unit due to the quality of the finished product. I should also mention, this unit is made from very thin labratory type glass. Extreme caution should be used or it can and will shatter very easily.

"Works great, easy to use","5,0 de 5 estrellas","They made coffee making as easy as possible. It's ready to go when you take it out of the box. You give the glass hourglass jar and metal filter a quick rinse with water. To make the coffee, place the filter into the hourglass. It fits perfect. Then, put ground coffee into the filter, and pour hot water (just less than boiling) into the the filter. The coffee gets made in 3 to 5 minutes. Once done, the filter is left with wet coffee grounds, as is expected. I take the filter outside to my planter and pour a large cup of water onto it to get out most of the grounds. Then, rinse it out in the kitchen sink until clean. I do it right away. Give them a good rinse and place face down onto a dry paper towel. They dry naturally. I've used mine about 8 times.

Updated Review,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I had to give it a one star because that's the only way I could write a review. The only thing I can say regarding this is that it is very thin glass, never even had a chance to use it. The directions tell you to wash before using, which we did, however; the unit slipped out of my hands, hit the sink and broke into pieces. Wish I could have used it and reviewed the coffee making process itself, but this is all I can say.

Update: Gator customer service is excellent, they replaced my pour over coffee maker that I broke with no issue.
Guided me in proper use and followed up on my progress, just outstanding service, Thank you.

Manchmal kann einfach auch gut sein :-) - Filter nur mit Wasser aussp√ºlen - innen nicht abtrocknen,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Die Idee und die Umsetzung sind einfach. Filter oben drauf, Kanne darunter und es kann losgehen. Unsere erste Kanne ist leider beim Saubermachen an den Wasserhahn gesto√üen und hat einen Riss bekommen. Deswegen habe ich mir den Gator noch mal bestellt.

Bei Geschmack habe ich 4 Sterne gegeben, ich finde gerade bei selbst gemahlenen Kaffee-Bohnen (die ja nicht ganz so fein gemahlen werden sollen), l√§uft das Wasser etwas zu schnell durch den Filter. Deswegen nehme ich etwas mehr Pulver als eigentlich n√∂tig w√§re.

Beim Reinigen des Filters muss man etwas aufpassen, am besten nur mit Wasser aussp√ºlen. Wenn man zu stark an die Naht kommt wo der Filter √ºberlappt, entsteht hier ein kleiner Falz (siehe Bild). Der st√∂rt nicht weiter, man darf halt nicht mit einem Trockentuch etc. reinwischen, sonst k√∂nnte die Naht aufgehen (f√ºrchte ich).",Miti,Revisado en Alemania el 5 de mayo de 2020
Worth the jump,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","So, I am incredibly nerdy about my coffee. As in, I roast my own beans, package them in custom printed bags, perfectly grind them, and usually brew in a machine called the ""connoisseur."" I had not made the jump to pour over yet. Obviously, I was aware of it. I just did not know if it would be that big of a difference.

It is totally worth the jump. I am not sure I can go back to my pre-pour over days. The pour over machine is easy to use. Easy to clean. Takes a little bit of time and effort, but makes amazing coffee. My wife, who typically adds ungodly amounts of creamer to her coffee, has even decided to drink this coffee black a few times. It is absolutely amazing, and totally worth the jump.",Jonathan Hanover,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de julio de 2019

UPDATE: I have been pleasantly surprised by Coffee Gator's customer service. In less than 24 hours the team emailed me to discuss the problem, thereby resulting in a mutually agreeable solution.

The filter is great and easy to clean with a quick rinse. No more wasting of paper filters anymore is a nice benefit also. Because it's made of stainless steel and glass, I no longer have to worry about plastic leaching into my coffee!

The best part may be their customer service! I very recently broke one of my carafes due to my own stupidity and Jani took care of me!

Fragile,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I've owned two of these and both have broken very easily. First one was broken when my toddler climbed the counter and tipped it over. I didn't actually see it happen, so I wasn't certain if she used excessive force when doing so. However, I broke my second one this morning by simply knocking it over in my sink while cleaning it. If it was full with liquid, I would understand it breaking on impact due to the weight. The unit was empty, though. This leads me to believe my toddler broke the first one by simply knocking it over as well.

I liked the handle and that there were measurement markings. The markings held up well and I never noticed signs of wear.

Lots of room for error,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This seemed simple enough to use, but turns out there is a lot of room for error in terms of the coffee-to-water ratio and type of grind. Directions say to use ""coarsely ground"" coffee, but that could be a big range apparently, as I noticed that sometimes the water pours through the coarse ground beans slowly (what you want) whereas sometimes it pours through quickly (what you don't want), so you end up with either a nice, strong, flavorful cup of coffee or a weak, watery, disgusting cup. There isn't a sure-fire way to know what will happen once you pour the water in, so you risk wasting the coffee grounds if the latter scenario happens. Maybe I just need more practice, but this isn't the anxiety I want early in the morning when I'm still half asleep!

The beaker tipped over and just like that, I move from the 'those that will' to 'those that did' break the glass. Bummer.

Not as practical as it sounds,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I was very excited to find a pour over brewer giving me just the amount of coffee I drink in the morning. However, it isn't as good as it sounds. First, the filter is much too small. It holds the grounds to the top and you have to pour water in very small amounts to prevent overflowing. The second drawback is that the sleeve is not big enough and you come in contact with the very hot glass. Also, the plastic conducts heat so pouring becomes painful.

Very thin glass,"3,0 de 5 estrellas",Very excited to start using it. It's very nice looking drip. Reason I gave it 3 stars was because how thin the glass is.

The coffee maker is very nice. There is one minor problem,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","The coffee maker is very nice. There is one minor problem, which may not actually be an issue for most people. The holes at the bottom of the filter that comes with the filter are large so I have to use my filter within the filter that came with the coffee maker in order to make the strength coffee that I like. If I don't do this then the water runs through the grounds too fast making a weak pot of coffee.

I would purchase this product again, as the quality of the product is great. It is nice to have a handle to make pouring the coffee easy.

I do use a paper filter with the filter basket because I do not care for the fine coffee ""dust"" that we get at the end of the pot as we also get when using press and drip processes.And, using a paper filter makes it much easier to dispense with the grounds. One thing I did notice is that the company logo (in black on outside of the glass ""pot"") begins rubbing away even right after the initial unit washing (too bad) ... yet it doesn't hurt the end result.",L H.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de noviembre de 2017

I've had some close calls with the glass carafe (read: have knocked it over on various hard surfaces), but have been surprised by it's durability. Until yesterday. I knocked it over in my sink and boom, cracked and irreparable. I really wish they had an option to replace just the carafe since the filter is fine, but I can't seem to find one.

Three decent sized cups of coffee!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","The pour over coffee pot is ideal for two people who can each drink a cup and a half of coffee. The steel filter cleans easily, you don't have leftover coffee to reheat, and you're not wasting coffee beans. It is constructed with a light weight glass, however, and a careless bang against the counter could easily crack the glass. It would make for a more durable, glass coffee pot if the designers added a rubber weighted bottom, much like my dog's weighted water bowl. That way the glass pot wouldn't skid, and a careless bang against the counter might not be the end of the pot.",Nancy from Massachusetts,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de abril de 2017
LOVE,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","LOVE this product, which I also got with the Gator pot to boil the water in. Some have complained that due to its size you have to pour the water over the coffee 3 -4 separate times which is true, but I don't mind this, as good coffee takes time (and it really doesn't take THAT much extra time to pour).
I only deducted one star because this gets very hot (DUH, you're pouring hot water into it) But the silicone grip around it is misleading because it too gets very hot and I need to use a towel or potholder to hold it when I pour my coffee in my mug.",Kristen,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de julio de 2016

Cheap and versatile,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I will admit the metal filter doesn‚Äôt yield the smoothest brew, but it‚Äôs one of the fastest and easiest ways to make coffee with the least cleanup. You can also brew cupping-style in the carafe and decant through the filter to get something much better than French press. I‚Äôve also discovered that Chemex filters fit in this if you add a tiny extra crease!

The reusable filter worlds well, removing all but the finest grounds. I do, however enjoy using a paper filter.

The only thing that's strange are the lines showing how much coffee is in the gator. It goes up to ""3"" ,however; I'm not sure what that unit is. I thought it was cups but if my gator is filled to ""3"" it just about fills a 12oz mug so I guess it counts by 4oz.

A Gift From Heaven!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My tastes changed after menopause and I could no longer enjoy coffee. It seemed to have a plastic taste. I went through several electric drip makers without success. This little brewer was a gift from heaven. The coffee comes in contact with stainless steel and glass. That‚Äôs it! The brew tastes like the coffee I remember. Warming the vessel, filter, and cup with hot water before brewing helps produce a truly hot cup of coffee. I also warm a marble coaster on which the brewer sits to further help with temperature retention. It‚Äôs a snap to clean. The only drawback is the time and attention it takes to fill the pot but this is a small price to pay for an excellent morning wake-up.",alice j. walker,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de julio de 2019

I wanted to give this product the proper testing it deserved for me to write a review that I didn't feel that I may have to edit later and change the review for the worse. I have to say this product has exceeded my expectation and I don't see a need for another coffee maker. I do like have there are enough holes for the coffee to penetrate through and you don't have to worry about anything. I do like how that I am able to make several cups of coffee all at once to server any possibly guest.

I was actually looking for a coffee pot that was certified to not have any BPA in the plastic when I found this. Read about how it is supposed to make the coffee taste so much better due to not striping out the natural oils, etc. Figured that was a bunch of hype, but I liked the idea of making my coffee more ""cleanly"" by using only stainless steel and glass so I ordered it. OMG!!! It seriously makes such a HUGE difference in the taste of the coffee that I was blown away. I can never go back to a stupid automatic coffee machine with a paper filter.

"Great value, but very delicate","5,0 de 5 estrellas","It worked very well, and really and truly is a great value. However,t he glass is very thin with no protection on the bottom of the carafe. I added a stick-on rubber feet which made me feel a little safer setting it down on my granite counter tops. In the end, I bumped it, it tipped over... and I was back to my french press. If you have soft wood or laminate counter tops it might not be an issue, but you might think twice with natural stone or concrete counters. When Coffee Gator learned of this failure they offered me a full refund... which is far beyond what I've come to expect from other vendors. While my unit did suffer an untimely death, I was blown away by Coffee Gator's excellent customer service. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they will come up with another version which is a bit more sturdy (or less likely to tip when empty).",David Esler,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de enero de 2017

As am I researching on how to do proper pour over coffee, I realized that measurement is important for water and beans and I wanted a pot that actually has measurements on it so I ordered the Gator one. In comparison, the Gator one looks much better in terms of its construction. For one, that pot has a better glass, it has measurements on it, and that filter wow! Nothing compared to the Bodum filter. You will love the Gator filter, better construction, better filter. No comparison. So thank you considering your product was even cheaper and yet better quality.

... Gator's smaller Pour Over Coffee Maker and have been delighted with it,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",I own Coffee Gator's smaller Pour Over Coffee Maker and have been delighted with it. This larger size has all the same features as the smaller one. The strainer design has holes at the the very bottom tip and has the tab to better grip it. This tab is helpful in dumping the grounds out. The flask has a real handle instead of a wooden collar. I previously had another brand's larger sized coffer maker. I have found that the Coffee Gator's screen design allows the hot water to flow through at a better rate than my previous large one. Note to cat owners: Don't leave your coffee maker unsheltered on counters. Cats are jerks; my cat pushed my old larger sized coffee maker off the counter onto to floor.

"Exceptional customer service! The carafe works well, but the filter is the weak point","5,0 de 5 estrellas","Updated on 3/27/18: After my intitial review, customer service contacted me immediately and sent out a replacement filter for free. That is what will make me come back as a customer if I'm ever in the market for another product like this - product flaws happen, but the way the company responds is what is important, and this company values their customers.

Initial review:
First shipment had a chip on the lip of the carafe; after I requested a refund, customer service was exceptionally quick to send out a replacement. Unfortunately the filter is not so great - the rubber grip came off within a few weeks, which is not a big deal, you just have to be careful when you wash the filter. But last week the cone-part came away from the rim completely, it can't be fixed.",KA,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de enero de 2018
What's not to love?! This is my first pour over coffee ...,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","What's not to love?! This is my first pour over coffee maker and its amazing. My coffee has never tasted better. The extra time it takes to make my coffee in the morning is totally worth it. I wake up in the morning and look forward to doing it. It makes the coffee taste so smooth, you can't beat it.

Pros: amazing coffee taste, beautiful coffee maker that looks great sitting out on the counter, excellent easy clean mesh filter

Cons: the glass is VERY thin. I have a 2 year old, granite counters, and 2 cats... I'm a little concerned about how long my coffee maker will stay in 1 piece. And there is nothing to keep the coffee warm

Some advantages over the excellent Chemex products.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have been using a Chemex for a year or two and liked it a lot. The Chemex looks cooler. The CoffeeGator has a somewhat more functional, chemistry lab look. I prefer the silicon insulator over the Chemex wooden one, even though the latter is more aesthetically pleasing. I prefer this little coffee maker over the Chemex because of the stainless steel filter and because the glass is marked 1, 2, 3 cups. The other thing I find interesting, and can't really explain, is it takes less time to make the coffee with the CoffeeGator. The water slips faster through the permanent filter. Now, you'd think that would make for a weaker cup of coffee, but nope. Don't ask me. Do I look like a scientist to you? Anyway, excellent product, although I'd say it's over-priced by about $5.00.",Dale Wisely,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de noviembre de 2017
Lebensbereichrung,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Ich benutze auf Arbeit die 400ml Variante f√ºr Kaffee und die 800ml Variante f√ºr Tee und bin absolut begeistert. Vor allem der Kaffee ist extrem lecker, im Vergleich zum gleichen Tee mit anderen Br√ºhmethoden.

Die 400ml Kanne ist mir leider kaputt gegangen, da ich sie aus Versehen gegen den Sp√ºlbeckenrand gedonnert habe aber wenn man nicht rumschusselt, ist es sehr best√§ndig und verzeiht viele St√∂√üe.

Lediglich die 800ml Variante ist im ""Bauch"" schwer zu reinigen, wenn man nicht passende Mittel zur Verf√ºgung hat aber da ich meist Gr√ºntee koche und die Kanne nach Benutzung gr√ºndlich aussp√ºle, st√∂rt mich das keineswegs.

Auch Fragen zum Filter wurden super schnell und kompetent vom Support beantwortet.

It's easy to use, the filter is great because it keeps small pieces of coffee grounds out of your coffee, and is still easy to clean. My boyfriend also says he likes being able to see the coffee in the carafe as he is brewing it, because when we had previously used an individual pour over that went on top of a mug he had to keep lifting it up to see when it was full. He also likes the measuring lines on the sides so he knows he is using the amount of water he planned on based on the amount of coffee grounds he used.

Excellent,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","LIked it very much! It iss attractive and works perfectly. I had one of the cones that you balance on top of a cup or carafe.

Since I only make coffee in the morning when I am tired and clumsy I got this item to prevent that situation from ever happening again.

I do not like putting hot water into anything that is plastic, so I can't use coffee regular makers.

Lecker Kaffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Ich hatte mir vor einiger Zeit bereits diesen Kaffeebereiter gekauft und habe es absolut nicht bereut. Der Grund, warum ich ihn noch mal gekauft habe, ist meine Schusseligkeit. Beim Reinigen habe ich leider die Kanne zerdeppert. Daher habe ich bei Robustheit nur 4 Sterne gegeben. Es ist halt Glas und nicht unkaputtbar.

Alles Andere ist absolut Top. Der Filter macht seine Arbeit wirklich gut, ist leicht zu reinigen und die Glaskaraffe ebenso. Ich benutze das Set mehrmals am Tag und bin immer wieder begeistert wie einfach es doch ist, guten Kaffee zu bereiten.

Einziger Kritikpunkt (wenn man das so nennen kann): Die Gr√∂√üe der Karaffe. Ich w√ºrde mir eine Karaffe w√ºnschen, mit der man 1 liter Kaffee machen kann. Zum einen trinke ich viel Kaffee und zum Anderen w√§re es bei G√§sten einfacher.",Amazon Kunde,Revisado en Alemania el 1 de noviembre de 2019

French press convert!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","It was time to change my press, since the mesh along the sides of the plunger were fraying to an annoying level. I've had pour over coffee before, but never at home. For one thing, I have no desire to use paper filters to make my coffee. I was intrigued by Coffee Gator's fine mesh filter cone.

I received it in perfect condition and it holds more coffee than I had estimated. You can easily serve 2 people 16oz cups from one pour session. Takes a a few minutes and I have even more flavorful coffee than the press.

Great pour over solution,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been using this carafe and reuseable filter for over two years. It's a very fine stainless filter so the sediment is minimal. You can of course add a paper filter if you wish- I don't. Control your beans, grind, water temperature and proportions, and you will make outstanding coffee.

The company states it is not recommended to wash the carafe in a dishwasher. I have ignored this mostly but am also on my third carafe in two years, so take that into account when you decide how to clean it.
