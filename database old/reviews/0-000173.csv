I just heated the milk up on the stove and then poured it into this hot pot and it stayed hot for hours and hours! I also liked that it came with a cleaning wand to help get inside of it. The biggest reason I bought this one was because the reviews about it being easy to dispense the liquid.

Way More than I Expected,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I drink a lot of tea, and instead of brewing a cup at a time I make a pot and pour it in here and it keeps it warm for me throughout the work day. I wasn't expecting it to look at nice as it does, and I love the fact that the cap keeps the liquid so securely in the carafe. You push the button and it seals it, and you push it again and it pours. I really dislike those carafes where you have to turn the top to open it up and you are never sure by whether or not is us securely locked.

I don't write a ton of reviews, but I am looking at buying a second one now that I am back at the office part of the time and I don't usually like something so much I will buy it again without hesitation.",Alex Black,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de septiembre de 2023

So I bought this and I fill it with boiling water and it stays hot all day. Then I bring tea bags or loose tea of various varieties and people can make their own hot steaming cups of 茶。

It comes with a cleaning brush, and due to the smallish opening it isn't easy to dry it with a towel, so I just make sure to let it air dry before putting it away for our next outing.",Jim Gottlieb,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de mayo de 2023

Im Praxistest habe ich die Kanne mit heißen Wasser ""vorgewärmt"" und dann den frisch gebrühten Kaffee aufgefüllt. Nach gut 2,5 Stunden war der Kaffee leider nur noch warm und noch grenzwertig zu genießen.
Wenn ich viel Besuch habe und ordentlich Kaffee getrunken wird, dann ist die Kanne brauchbar, aber bei längeren Anwendungen ist sie leider nur unterer Durchschnitt.

Poor quality - do not buy,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I am not sure how this could be Germany quality. In fact, this thing lasted no longer than the cheapest airpot I have purchased elsewhere. As others have mentioned, the item is actually manufactured in China. Despite the seller's assurance that this has ""long-term durability"" and the quality from Pykal, it is nothing but.

As some others have noted in their reviews, the pump eventually pumps less and less liquid over time. This is due to the fact that the plastics used on the pumping mechanism is very cheaply made and gets brittle over time. Every single time you open and close the lid, you are essentially applying pressure to that plastic piece up top which eventually results in it cracking and the seal broken (hence very little water comes out with each pump.) The worst part is (as you can seen in the picture) -- tiny particles of the plastic gets mixed in with the water which becomes unsafe to use.

Unfortunately, this item lasted only about 2 years, and upon contacting customer service about it, they simply said this was beyond their warranty period and fail to assist further. Save your money and buy something of better quality. This is no better than the other cheap garbage that's out there.",# ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ ~ ~ ~,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de diciembre de 2022

For our family, I can whip up a quick ""Tea Party"" for my littles (but dilute b/c it is hot!). It is great to take on road trips-we fill it before hitting the road (like camping is great!) and when you arrive you have a hot cup of tea or coffee available all day long. Also great for company. Make it before company arrives and you can focus on your company and not preparing a hot beverage for them (my Mom in particular is always in awe of this thing for that reason, she always knows it's full and ready and loves how easily it dispenses). After a year of off and on use, the pumping mechanism was failing. Pushing the pump and minimal liquid would come out.

THIS wonderful carafe keeps my tea piping hot up to 24 hours if need be!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I was tired of making my tea one cup at a time, or making a pot of tea, only to have it last for 3 possibly 4 twelve oz cups, the last three of which were lukewarm or cold. I grew up drinking Early Grey, but I can no longer tolerate the caffeine (insomnia). After trying zillions of varieties of herbal teas, and not really enjoying any of them much, I had almost quit drinking tea. Then I discovered Vahdam's herbal spiced turmeric teas, and I am back at tea drinking again (Yay). So then I decided to figure out how to best make 64+ oz of tea in the morning and be able to drink it just-brewed hot throughout the day!
After finding a large enough teapot (Harold Import Co's 75 oz, 12-cup Ceramic teapot - A++), the perfect infuser for this teapot (House Again's ""Extra Fine Mesh Tea Infuser"" - with arms A+), I then researched carafes extensively and ended up purchasing Pykal's 68 oz ""Thermal Coffee Carafe With Therma-Click Lid.""
This Pykal Thermal Carafe comes with clear instructions on how to best use this carafe so it will keep your tea or coffee piping hot all day (12-15 hrs), or even after 24 hours (this is best done by pre-heating the carafe with boiling water for 30 minutes, then Completely Filling the carafe as directed - the tea or coffee will then be piping hot). I preheat the carafe with boiling water in the morning for about 15-30 minutes (more is better). Once my tea is prepared I pour out the boiling water, and pour in the tea, and close the lid securely. For the rest of the day, I can click open the lid (press it down), and pour myself a freshly brewed-tasting cup of hot tea. I am in heaven.
At the end of the day I just rinse out the carafe. It comes with an effective, good quality, long-handled sponge cleaning utensil specifically made for the carafe. I only use the sponge utensil about 1x/wk with a drop of dish detergent, really just for the heck of it, because the tea I am drinking doesn't stain like coffee or black tea. So after just over 1 month of use, it still looks brand new inside and out.
It also pours well and without incident. After reading a review that mentioned leaking, I filled the carafe with hot tap water all the way to the top, sealed it, and then slowly inverted the carafe as if to pour. No water leaked from my Carafe. Since then, I haven't needed to hold the carafe past a 45 degree angle when pouring out the end of the tea in the carafe and haven't experienced any leaks (no need to tempt fate).
And after all of this, the Carafe also comes with a warranty. It is a quality product made by a company that stands behind its products and offers quality customer service. Now I have my eye on their tea kettle! I am So Happy! I am just really happy with this purchase, and I rely on reviews (real ones) for just about every purchase I make, and am grateful for those who take the time. I am not a paid reviewer, nor a representative of Pykal.",Avidspider,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de marzo de 2020

This Airpot is great for hot and cold beverages alike!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased the Pykal SplashProof Coffee Carafe Airpot Dispenser with Adjustable Nozzle, and so far I think it is great! I've had it for a couple of days so far. First of all it holds up to 120oz, so nearly a gallon of capacity, which is plenty enough for me and my family members. When I received it, it came well packed in a nice box. It came with a cleaning brush and an easy set of instructions. It also has information to register for a 1 year warranty, and a link to instructional videos online plus an ebook.

I had no trouble setting it up and filling it with hot tea for the first trial. Setup is easy and fast. It kept the tea good and hot for well over 7 hours, and by that time I didn't need to keep the tea hot any longer, although I am sure it would have worked for a much longer time.

I like that the base swivels and allows me to easily turn the Airpot around to any direction while it is sitting on the counter. I also really like the extendable nozzle, which lets me pour into a shorter mug or a taller vessel with a simple adjustment, and avoids any spills. I found that pressing the top was easy, and my 11 year old could do this to dispense his drink with no issues as well. You can press the top and hold it down to get more liquid until it stops or your cup is full, and I found it shouldn't take more than a couple of presses to fill a small cup.

After the first filling with tea, I made pink lemonade with ice, and used the Airpot to dispense that. The Airpot kept it nice and cold for many hours.

When I was all done using the Airpot, cleanup was easy, just rinsing it out with hot water and a little soap. You can run some through the spout to clean that part as well, then just run some clean water through to make sure the soap is out. The included brush will be useful for cleaning I imagine after I have used the Airpot more, but I haven't even needed to use that so far, water has done the trick.

Next I am thinking I will try hot chocolate in the Airpot, it should do great for that. It would no doubt be awesome for coffee drinkers as well, but I don't personally drink coffee. I am very happy with this purchase, and I think I will be using the Airport quite a bit for various beverages.",Grimmreeper,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de febrero de 2019
"Sturdy, keeps coffee hot","4,0 de 5 estrellas","My favorite carafe of 20+ years bit the dust in a freak accident so I had to find another...not an easy task. Tried a couple that were a complete failure...leaked, didn't keep coffee/beverage hot, big/bulky/awkward... So far this one has come the closest to getting the job done. It can hold a full pot of coffee (12-14 cups) and keep it hot for an extended time, however it is necessary to pre-warm the carafe as noted in the instructions in order to obtain maximum results. Spent 8 hours outside, from 25-40 degrees, and the coffee stayed mostly hot. Last cup was more ""very warm""... the less coffee there is in the carafe to keep it warm, the quicker it cools. But got me through the cold day with hot coffee at my disposal, so still a win. The Therma-Click lid makes it extremely easy and convenient to pour- even with one hand, with a little cover over the spout to keep anything from falling in. However, I have found that it is also easy to accidentally press the lid, popping it open, and allowing the heat to escape and contents to spill. Now I know to keep an eye on it and make sure it stays closed. I need a carafe that can keep up with all I put it through...long hours out in the cold, getting knocked around...and so far, for the most part this one has delivered.",Josi,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de marzo de 2020
LARGE CAPACITY STYLISH CARAFE THAT KEEPS WARM BEVERAGES WARM,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I generally make coffee using a manual plunger type device (AeroPress). This is fine for the two of us. The problem is this is not timely for a crowd. I use a Chemex pour over carafe when entertaining. However, for visitors staying over several days, even a Chemex is problematic when guests do not get up at the same time and may want good coffee throughout the day. That's where the Pykal thermal carafe comes to the rescue.
The first thing I needed to verify for myself was its heat keeping qualities. I did my own test by preheating the carafe with hot tap water for ten minutes per the instructions then filling the carafe with 195F water. I tested the temperature drop using an instant read thermometer at 12 hours and 24 hours. The water started at 188F and dropped to 159F at twelve hours and 142F at 24 hours. This was a home test not a lab test. Ha Ha. Heat keeping duties passed with flying colors.

The Pykal thermal carafe will more than meet your needs. It looks elegant and would be at home alongside your best coffee service. It is as easy to use as pressing a button and pouring a wonderful cup of coffee that tastes like you just made it even if you ""just"" made it six hours ago! No messing around for your guests having to put a small packet of ground coffee beans in a contraption and waiting for mediocre coffee to come out.
It also has some nice features besides the click n pour. Your guests may not notice but you will appreciate the stainless steel insides and outside, the non-skid bottom and the ergonomic handle as well as the dust proof pour spout. And Pylal packs a long handle sponge cleaning tool that actually reaches the bottom of the carafe! How nice is that?

I highly recommend this product. You'll by happy with it.

Works great at keeping coffee hot!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this hoping for a thermos type container that will keep my coffee hot through the day in cold temperatures. I was not disappointed! I filled it with coffee in the morning from my coffee maker (I did not super heat it to boiling or anything like that, simply brewed a pot and poured it in, then added cold creamer). I dispensed one travel mug worth of coffee immediately and then left the Airpot in my truck on a day where temperatures ranged from 12 to 18 degrees F. I dispensed a second travel mug worth at my break a few hours later and the coffee was still steaming. Same at lunch time. At the end of the day (12 hours later in those cold temperatures), I dispensed one last cup just to see how warm it still was expecting lukewarm coffee by that point (cold temperatures outside plus now only having half a carafe left). I was surprised! The coffee was still hot! Not quite steaming at that point, but certainly not lukewarm. This Airpot worked well!

Another bonus with this Airpot is the included cleaning brush. It would be difficult to clean the inside of this Airpot without the brush and having one included is a great thought. There is even a little spout cleaning brush hidden in the handle to clean the spout.

One minor note for using this Airpot: I was using it for my tall travel mug and thus had to dispense my coffee off the side of my tailgate to fit my cup under the spout. This Airpot is meant for shorter mugs, Styrofoam cups, etc., not a tall travel mug. I will probably be giving this to my church to use during fellowship times because of that since they use the styrofoam cups for coffee and tea. This Airpot would be perfect in that environment!

One possible minor area of improvement would be the ring on the bottom of the Airpot, meant to enable the Airpot to turn. The ring is simply plastic and did slide on my counter a little instead of turn. It could be because of a slick counter top, but I feel if there was a rubber bottom to this plastic ring, it would work better at holding it's grip to the counter top and allowing the Airpot to turn. This is a very minor detail and was not enough for me to deduct a star. I wanted a container to keep my coffee hot for an extended period of time in cold weather, and this Airpot does that wonderfully!",Andrew S.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de febrero de 2019

AMAZING it works great!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this for a meeting (20 people) and I was serving Chai tea. I drove 2 hrs to the location (8am) with the tea pretty hot so by the time I was going to serve it (3pm) it will still warm. Well... it was not only warm but HOT, still 7hrs later, hot like it was when I made it at 8am! after serving in the glass we needed to wait to be able to drink it.
I had 1/3 of the chai tea in the thermo left so I took it back home and left it inside on my kitchen and in the morning to my surprise it was still pretty warm, YES! 24hr later!! Anyway, I read the reviews so I wasn't expecting this, I though it was going to be ok, warm a few hrs later but in my case, it was actually HOT all day.
Also, the flow was great! every time your pump was long and strong. You will fill up a glass with just 2 pumps... very good.
The last thing, it is very, very easy to clean, you can even fit your whole hand inside the opening! it comes with a brush but I didn't used it because I can go all the way inside with my hand my sponge.

Cannot Clean Cap and Material Affects Flavor,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","The two major and one minor negatives, unfortunately, outweigh the two major positives.

I use my carafe for expensive specialty coffee from coffee farms all over Colombia that I purchase directly from the main plantation that exports it all. The different varieties of specialty coffee have their distinct flavor profiles and characteristics of the different locales from around the country, some quite coveted.

I brew 80 grams at a time to make 1 L of coffee, I do this twice in a row to make 2 L batches, use a Chemex pour-over system, and grind the beans within 2-5 minutes of brewing.

PROS

1) The 68 oz (2 L) capacity allows me to make and store 2 L of coffee.
2) The carafe is able to keep the coffee very hot for several hours. 12 hours later it is hottish. 24 hours later there is some warmth.

The lab-tested 150° F heat retention claim is not realized in actual practice. If you fill the carafe to capacity and do not use any of the liquid, 24 hours later it might still remain pretty hot. But the smaller the amount of hot liquid that you keep in the carafe the less effective it is at heat retention.

So if you decant amounts of liquid from the carafe over the course of 24 hours, it only stays hot for about 6-8 hours, then degrades to hottish by 12 hours, and after 24 hours is just warm. Still, I think at this time there is probably no other carafe that performs better at keeping liquids hotter for longer.

CONS

1) There is no way to open the cap so that it can be washed.

The surfaces that the coffee touches inside the cap cannot be reached directly to scrub and cannot be reached with a brush. It can be clicked open and set inside a container of soapy water, then rinsed under a faucet and soaked with clean water to finish rinsing.

Drying is a problem. You cannot wipe the inside of the cap dry. You can click it open and shake it until most of the rinse water is gone, but you cannot completely dry it. Allowing tap water to eventually evaporate dry is not good in my situation where I go out of my way to remove tap water contaminants. Wiping dry with a paper towel would be satisfactory, but cannot be done with this cap.

The only way for me to remove contaminants from the hot, tap rinse water is for me to use my specially filtered (ClearlyFiltered) water, intended solely for brewing the coffee, for a final rinse to remove as much residual contaminants as possible before using it for a new round of coffee. The fact that you can't wash the inside of the cap means this carafe is unsatisfactory.

2) The material of which the thermal reservoir is made imparts its own flavor on the contents. This makes this carafe totally unacceptable.

The reservoir is not made of glass but rather some metallic material. This metallic material has a flavor of its own that is transmitted to whatever it is holding hot. I do not know if this affects liquids intended to be kept cold. The sole purpose of this carafe for me is to retain the heat of freshly brewed specialty coffee.

I put considerable effort into extracting the exquisite flavors of what is sometimes extremely expensive coffee. The Moka I have just received from the plantation sold out in less than a day and is about $44/pound. The 2 L batch I brew costs $15.56 just for the beans. I don't want to taste the inside of my carafe along with the Moka or other specialty coffee.

But that's what happens. I pour a couple of large vessels of coffee right out of the Chemex brewer, the best it will ever be. But then I have to keep it somewhere to stay hot throughout the day. So it goes into this carafe that changes the flavor. It absolutely degrades the flavor and value of the coffee, so this carafe is only a short-term solution until I can get one that works good enough, can be thoroughly cleaned, and does not change the flavor of my coffee.

3) Finally, when the liquid is poured it does not pour smoothly, it splatters.

The liquid goes from the reservoir through the cap and out to its spout. It then splatters into whatever vessel is receiving the liquid. There is no smooth pour of any kind. The spout looks like it will pour smoothly, but it does not.

The spout shape has nothing to do with how it pours. It just comes out of the cap into the spout area in a more of a fan than a stream which causes the splattering. This effect occurs from the first pour to the last. It is a design flaw, but one I could live with if the cap could be washed and the material of the container did not impart its own flavor on the hot liquid it is holding.",R.

Hot coffee all morning and no burnt taste.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I really like my new Pykal Airpot. It is big enough to hold two pots of coffee from my 10 cup coffee maker and it keeps the coffee hot all morning. I really don't like the taste of coffee that has been sitting on the burner for an hour or two and it can take my brother and I that long to drink a pot of coffee. Sunday morning, after receiving the Pykal Airpot on Saturday afternoon, I preheated the pot with hot water out of my electric tea kettle and put two pots of coffee in it. The last cup was just as hot as the first.

I tested the Airpot shortly after I received it on Saturday afternoon. I fill the pot with boiling water from my electric tea kettle and let it preheat while I ran water through my coffee maker. After pouring out the water used for preheating, I poured in the hot water from the coffee maker, closed it up and ran another pot of coffee through the coffee maker and poured that pot in the Airpot. It fit, so no wasted coffee for two pots of coffee. I checked the temp of the water in the coffee maker at 1:30 pm EST and it was at 199 degrees F. After an hour, it was at 198 degrees F. I then went about my day, and forgot about the Airpot. Around 7:30 pm EST, I checked it again and the water was 194 degrees F. That's plenty hot enough for coffee. The pot was full all day, so that may have had some effect, but I think that was pretty good.

When the Airpot was recommended to me, the main selling point was that the pot kept hot liquid hot and cold liquid cold. I can say it worked very well on hot liquids. It was easy to clean, although I use a soft bristle bottle brush and a drop of dish detergent to clean out the Airpot.

I can hardly wait for tailgating season. We start our tailgates early and I always need coffee.",J. Monagin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de febrero de 2019
Awesome Airpot!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","First of all, let me say, the folks at Pykal are concerned #1 with customer satisfaction. If you have any problems whatsoever with their products, they are just an email away. They have come up with an amazing airpot!

It's beautiful stainless steel inside and out, and I can operate it with one hand even with osteoarthritis in all the joints of both hands. The pull-down spout is one of my favorite features. It lets you direct the liquid into a regular cup or a larger mug with NO splashing. The swivel base is a nice touch, and is smooth as silk when you rotate it. The claim that it keeps liquids hot for 24 hours is the truth. I started with a full pot of hot water at 205 degrees Fahrenheit. Two hours later, I dispensed three cups of water which were still at 190 degrees. Several hours later, a cup of dispensed water was still at 175 degrees. The next morning, almost 24 hours later, the dispensed water still measured 135 degrees. This pot would perform perfectly for a group gathering that was going to last several hours for sure. The coffee, tea or hot chocolate would still be nice and hot and drinkable at the end of any multiple-hour gathering. It has a generous 120 oz/3.5 liter capacity.

One problem I have with most airpots is that they drip after dispensing requiring a paper towel under the spout to keep from collecting a puddle of water. The Pykal pot had a very minimal drip of maybe one or two drops after dispensing.

I highly recommend this airpot. I can imagine using it for family gatherings at holidays or for things like a book club meeting or committee meeting for an organization.

The pot comes with a one year guarantee which you register online. They have a great video for proper use, care and cleaning of the aipot.",Brenda Muncrief,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de febrero de 2019
"Says what it does, Does what it says","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I roast and grind my own beans and brew my coffee with a vacuum pot, so I’m a bit fanatical about good coffee. The only downside to a vacuum pot is that, as with a pour over, the coffee does not stay hot in the pot. It’s not a problem if I’m just making coffee for myself, but if I have multiple guests staying with us, it makes the morning coffee routine cumbersome and problematic. Solution? Get a really good coffee thermos, where I can have two full pots of coffee ready and waiting. To put it simply, this thermos says what it does and does what it says.

After reading some of the reviews, I started by cleaning it well, first with soap and water ( the inclusion of the cleaning brush is a helpful touch), then vinegar, and a good rinse with boiling water. Next I filled it with boiling water, sealed it, and checked the next morning to test it’s efficiency. It was still piping hot! I dumped that water out, then began using the pot regularly, never experiencing any kind of aftertaste issues. While you are brewing your coffee, fill the pot about a quarter of the way with hot water to warm the interior, just so you won’t be putting hot coffee into a stone cold thermal carafe. If you fill it pretty full and seal it as recommended, your coffee will stay hot all day. Of course as you drain the quantity, the thermal mass goes down, more air space is introduced, and the remaining coffee will cool faster, but if you have a number of people partaking of coffee, you will still easily get through a service with everyone enjoying their beverage piping hot. This is a very good thermos at a very reasonable price point. It is simple and modern in appearance, well balanced, easy to pour from, and easy to clean. I would definitely recommend it!",Californiaboy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de enero de 2020
Has a design flaw,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I like the carafe, it keeps things hot for quite a while, but it has a design flaw. If you tip it too high the liquid pours out around the seal. I spoke with the company and while they tried to be helpful (even offered to let me exchange it for another product) they stated that the design of this carafe did not allow for you to pour out the last of the contents.

Watch the video and you will see what I'm talking about. This works fine except when I get down to my last cup of coffee, at which point I have to tilt the carafe at an angle where the coffee spills out around the seal and onto my hand. I almost burned myself the first time this happened. Now that I know about it, I just make sure to pour the last cup over the sink with my hand out of the way.

The design flaw is where the spout is (see photo). There is a rubber seal on the lid so that when closed it seals against a rim on the carafe. The problem is this rim does not extend to where the spout is, so there is no seal there, allowing the liquid to bypass the seal and pour out around the lid. They could have easily extended the rim all the way around the top, leaving a passage underneath to allow the liquid to pour out but keeping the seal.

I still use this because I like how long it keeps things hot and I like the look and I enjoy the push to open feature of the lid. I just have to remember not to pour the last cup of coffee all over my hand.",Allen,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de enero de 2020
Excellent Manufacturer Customer Service,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I had initially purchased this Coffee Airpot from Amazon.com and had received a defective product. The original airpot was abnormally hot to the touch and could not retain the temperature after a few hours.

I had contacted the manufacturer, Pykal, about the issue and had received a replacement airpot. Pykal's customer service is outstanding and are very personable and friendly. They had responded to my inquiries very quickly and offered other suggestions for cleaning and preheating the airpot to increase the heat retention. They also have a wonderful 1 year warranty by registering the product on their website. Their customer service is the best that I've ever seen.

I love the design of this airpot and that it also holds a very large amount of liquid ~ 3.5 liters. It has a safety lock at the top and the carafe can also extend so that the hot coffee/water will not splash. This is a nice safety feature and avoids burns. The base can also swivel around turning the airpot 360 degrees without having to pick it up.

The opening is a slightly small for me, but I'm sure it would not be a problem for anyone with small hands. I am able to clean the airpot with a nice long bristle brush and hot soapy water.

It has now been about a week since I received my replacement airpot and I'm very pleased with the operation and performance of this airpot and I highly recommend it!",Matthew Merrill,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de noviembre de 2020
Very good heat retention,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is long overdue. I have the benefit of having the another Pykal carafe to test against. I much prefer the ThermaClick lid carafe to its predecessor. It is easier to operate, hold its heat better and has less drippage after you stop pouring. The older style would continue to pour after you ""closed"" the spout - not a lot, but enough to overflow a cup or if not drained, would give you a couple of cold tablespoons of coffee in your cup next time you poured. This ThermaClick lid maybe has a drip after you click the lid. The dust cover over the spout is a non issue & wish it were not there. I appreciate the idea, but does not open enough to get a brush in there to clean. The only thing I can say about my old glass carafe is a quick rinse and it was fresh inside - no lingering coffee orders. Every stainless steel (interior) carafe or cup needs an occasional scrub with BonAmi and really good rinse. The wonderful thing about this carafe is the wide mouth so you can scrub easily, but need a really long sturdy brush as it is very deep. The older one is more manageable size, the new ThermaClick works better, so will become my daily unit. It probably deserves 5 stars and very close to perfect; now a couple of months, I am still happy with the purchase.",DavidMC,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de agosto de 2019
This works fantabulous! Keeps liquids HOT!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This carafe is fantastic! It stays hot and we are grateful for that. Overnight it cools down some as there is less coffee in it but it’s perfect for my husband in the morning! I like my coffee HOT so having this is so awesome. For a good 12-15 hours it’s hot! Perfect for hot water too. Just make sure you get the carafe hot before you put your water/coffee in it. Also I noticed when I added more hot water/coffee to it I should have pushed the big button on top to release pressure; however, I unscrewed it before doing that. It just made a noise when releasing pressure. Nothing spit out thank goodness. That’s a plus! It’s a tall one too and holds a lot! It looks sleek too. I have had our other one 20+ years and it’s fine but this one sure keeps it hotter and it’s sleek looking too. The non-slip bottom is helpful too. The owners followed up with me! That blessed me to have them follow up to remind me to register it for the one year warranty!! I want to support their small business. I hope you like it as much as I do!!

Kept the tea piping hot and reasonably easy to clean,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Spot on on the heat retention. So-so for the cleaning. For those who complain about heat loss, you are doing it wrong. Always pour hot water (water from the pipe is better than nothing) into the flask to heat up the sides before pouring the tea/ coffee in. This will make sure that heat is not robbed from the drink to heat up the sides. That will definitely keep the heat in.

For the cleaning part, this is definitely better than other pots that I have used. I was able to remove the stem and send a straw cleaner down the spout to clean. The pot itself was another affair. A bottle brush cleaned the bottom and sides pretty easily. The part under the lid attached to the part is pretty difficult though. You have to do some gymnastics. That said, some good hot water, soap and some vigorous shaking combination did the trick but still unsatisfactory as I cannot see the results. I air-dried it to make sure that no moisture smells accumulate.

I will definitely recommend this product though as there are very few options in this price range to keep things hot for an elongated time. I use one for heat and one for cold and do not mix the two.",Sathyamoorthy Sridhar,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de diciembre de 2019
Keeps my coffee hot!!! Excellent Customer Service!!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","With all the time spent in quarantine we needed ready access to hot coffee. So I decided to find something to keep that coffee hot all day.

I was very excited to receive my airpot. Unfortunately, the first one I received had been seriously damaged. It looked like a return that hadn’t been checked by Amazon. Anyway. I ordered a replacement through amazon but I also contacted the seller because there was a suggestion inside the box to do so if there was a problem. I heard back right away from Lily who was very apologetic. What was really remarkable, though, was that Lily followed up twice while I waiting for my replacement.

2 days ago, earlier than I expected, the new pot arrived in perfect new condition. It would have been a bit tricky to figure out at first if not for the very detailed instructions regarding use and care written by lily. The pot worked wonderfully and kept out coffee hot all day. Very pleased.

Anything can go wrong with a transaction. What really matters is how well a problem gets resolved and Lily really has done a great job. They even include a specialized cleaning device.

Fantastic for Coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","So I drink much coffee. I like the K-Cups, but I also travel around a lot, and I was looking for something I could put in my truck, with a little car improvement work, so I could carry coffee around and have it stay warm, but also easy to dispense. This carafe has worked great for that. It carries much coffee and keeps it warm for a long time. Plus it is easy to distribute, push the pump button!

When you are not using it, you can push in the spigot and lock the button, so it makes it almost impossible to accidentally spill or make a mess. It also helps for different sized mugs when you are dispensing coffee from it.

It came with a nice little cleaning handle and sponge, like a Swiffer only for cleaning not dusting. So it is easy to keep clean when you need to, even on the go. Not to mention it is remarkably easy to take apart to clean.

I really like this unit and so far even being bounced around out in the oil fields, it is holding together nicely and I can also use it to fill a thermos if I am leaving the truck for a while.",Mitch,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de marzo de 2019
It's very good and keeps coffee warm a long time.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","The small opening makes it's more challenging to get the inside to clean. It's replaces one I have that has a wide opening that I can get my hand in and really scrub the inside, but I realize that the large lid is most likely where a lot of heat is lost, so it's a bit of trade off on design goals.
The click lid, when closed is very good at not leaking and keeping heat in. But we sometimes are not good about remembering to close it after use. Maybe there could be 2 options sold, one with a click lid, and one with the same tight internal seal, but a thumb lever to release it when pouring.
As some other reviewer pointed out, the last few ounces don't pour out too easily, and can make a mess if carafe is turned completely upside down with the lid open. I found that when trying to get the last couple of ounces out, it's better to take the lid off.",Randall,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de agosto de 2020
5 stars for the customer service,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought the thermal airpot last Nov for boiling water only cos I am a big fan of tea, it worked perfect until recent, the water couldn’t keep the temperate even for 6 hours, I noticed the outside was hot after I poured the boiling water in, fortunately it’s still in one year warranty, I reached out to the seller PYKAL for my issue, the manager Lily wrote me back right the next day and checked with me for some details, I took a video showing the outside increased temperature from 77 to 98 within half an hour after boiling water was added, Lily confirmed they would send me a new one as replacement and I also got one year warranty for that one! It took less then 7 days from I submitted my claim to get a new thermal airpot. although the first one didn’t last too long, I would give 5 stars for their good service, at least I know they are standing behind their products. Btw, make sure you don’t drop or hit the carafe, it will cause the heat leakage as per the seller.",Y. Shi,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de septiembre de 2020
"Easy to use and it does keep things hot for a long time, I actually tested it!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this to bring to a monthly craft group get together where we don't have access to a kitchen. So since this was the largest carafe I could find that still had a carrying handle, I ordered it. I really like it a lot. It's easy to carry, even when full, and it is simple to use. I also filled it with very hot water and then took temperatures of the water with my instant read digital meat thermometer. (probably not the best thing to use, but it is what I had on hand). Well, when I first filled it up with hot water (and I DID pre-warm the carafe with hot tap water for 10 minutes first, then dumped it out), the water measured 198 degrees F. Four hours later it was 180 degrees F. At 12 hours from starting it was 140 degrees F and at 22 hours from start it was at 125 degrees F. Finally at 24 hours the water registered at 120 degrees F. I am VERY happy with this carafe and have already told others in my craft club where to buy it.",Gayle,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de abril de 2019
I didn’t know how much I needed this.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I drink tea all day long from a 24-ounce insulated mug. I usually heat water each time my mug is empty. With the Airpot, I am able to heat water once in the morning and make tea as needed during the day with piping hot water. My mug is tall, so I swivel the Airpot toward the sink and can easily fill it without a splash using the convenient pull-down nozzle. Also, I have essential tremor, so I have spilled a lot of water when carrying it from the microwave and attempting to pour it into my mug. The Airpot solves that problem. I heat the water in my stainless Pykal teapot, and pour it into the Airpot for hot water all day. If I press firmly on the button, I can fill my mug with one press.

I much prefer stainless steel for items like this, as it is easy to scrub away odors. Including a cleaning brush is a very nice touch that shows customers that Pykal really has customer satisfaction in mind when designing their products and packaging. The Airpot has a nice weight and seems very sturdily made. I didn’t know how much I needed this, but it has made my life easier!",Diana Z,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de febrero de 2019
Very good product and excellent customer service!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I wanted an airpot for use on a beverage table during family gatherings and at church for Special events. I saw many features that I thought would be useful, Such as the large quantity of coffee that it would hold, the length of time that the coffee would be kept warm, and the splash proof nozzle. I also noted that the Pykal AirPod was highly rated, and so decided to place an order.

The air pot arrived quickly and in time for a special event on the weekend. I immediately tested the air pot to see that it would work properly for my event. I had some trouble with dripping from the spout and so I contacted customer service at Pykal.
Lily, the customer happiness manager 🙂, Was very helpful with remedies, ideas, and lastly with a replacement stem. I found the customer service outstanding and the replacement stem has made the air pot work very satisfactorily. I would recommend this company and this product",FDG,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de febrero de 2021
SAFETY???,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","SAFETY: I liked the fact that the height of the spout can be adjusted to a lower position because I felt there would be less chance of anyone getting burned. BUT...what I didn’t foresee is that a tall mug will not fit under the spout. I have to position the carafe at the edge of the counter, facing out, so that the spout overhangs the counter. Then someone holds the tall mug under the spout (which defeats my safety concern). A mug 4.75 inches will fit under the spout when the mug is sitting on the counter. . A mug 5.0 inches tall will not fit under the spout when the mug is sitting on the counter.

If you never use a mug taller than 4.75 inches, you will have no concerns and will love this airpot.",Linda Powers,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de diciembre de 2020
Perfect! Keeps coffee hot for hours! Just what I needed!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We recently went from one coffee drinker in the family (me) to three coffee drinkers, all wanting their coffee at different times. My aging father recently moved in with us, and my teenage son has started drinking coffee. This excellent carafe was the perfect answer! Whenever each one wants coffee, it’s hot and ready! I make 80 oz. of fresh ground coffee first thing the the morning, and after pouring my first cup, I fill the 2 liter carafe for others. Sometimes it’s a couple of hours, and I’ve left for work before my father is up for breakfast! When he has his breakfast, the coffee is hot and ready. We have two Bonavita Coffee Makers (excellent btw) which do not use hot plates to keep coffee warm (or scorched). This carafe is perfect for that! It will also be great to have this carafe when we host holiday family events, when I can’t usually stay ahead on the coffee for everyone. Now when family arrives there will be a carafe of fresh, hot coffee already to go while the next pots are brewing.","KC Royals Fan from Independence, MO",Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de noviembre de 2019
Big Bang for Your Buck,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The carafe came well packaged and with a very detailed instruction sheet. Included was also a cleaning brush, which is designed to clean your thermal carafe without scratching the metal interior.
It holds almost 2 liters of liquid, which surprised me.
Clean your carafe before use with warm soapy water and rinse out well.
Do follow the instructions of leaving hot water in the closed carafe for at least 10 minutes before you empty it and fill it with your actual beverage of choice.
I use it for tea and even after 18 hours the tea was too hot for just drinking it down. I'm very impressed with this thermal carafe and would highly recommend it. Do read the instruction manual and follow the steps. You will have a great product that should last for a long time.

Good one,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a good find to put your coffee in before it Cooks for 2 hours and becomes strong. This one does work real close to what the manufacturer says for hold time if you follow the instructions. It has some nice features a lock on the lid, the pump is fast/ 3 times to fill a cup, extension on the spout, and a handle you carry it around. I eventually figured out it has little wheels to make it turn to one side or the other. The only negative I found it does have a drip / you need to have a catch pan. I don't think you can find any better company than this one to take care of any problems. They responded very quickly to my issue and sent me a brand new pot for a broken spring.

My husband works from home and is a big tea drinker however a tea pot does not stay warm and were too small. I was really surprised at how long this keeps hot.

I start it at 5 am and its still hot in the evening. Infact its still warm in the morning when I clean it out and start it again. It comes with a cleaning brush and is easy to clean.

KEEPS COFFEE HOT!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This carafe replaced a glass lined carafe that we have been using for about 30 years. The best thing about this carafe is that it keeps the coffee really hot! I have had no problem with pouring the coffee out down to almost the last drop as some other reviewers have said. The little flap that covers the spout doesn't bother me, however it may be the reason why the last ounce or two doesn't come through - not enough pressure to open it. I just take the cover right off and pour the last little bit into my cup. No problem, and it's HOT. The best thing about the glass carafe is that you could keep it really clean with a little baking soda and hot water. So I was happy to receive the cleaning brush that they include with this new carafe.",BDM,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de agosto de 2020
Quality product,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is just a little too large for everyday use by my small family of two. We don’t make enough coffee to fully fill this, but even so, it keeps the coffee warm throughout the day, without that burned taste that you get if you leave it on the warmer or reheat in the micro. The coffee is still warm enough to drink the next day! You are supposed to rinse the carafe with warm water before filling it in order to preheat it for keeping the coffee warm and this works well for small amounts. This carafe would be really helpful at a dinner party or a feast event where you expect many guests. You could make the coffee hours before desert and keep it hot instead of that mad post dinner rush where your guests are sitting around waiting for coffee but you can’t make fast enough in your little coffee maker!",silkee,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de septiembre de 2019

Keeps coffe HOT,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This bottle really keeps coffee hot. It isn't perfect. The design of the cap and spout could be better. The contents of the bottle must pass through the cap though a valve. The seal works well and it may help with insulation. But, I would not put hot chocolate in it. I don't know how one would clean the cap. Then the little flap on the spout is all that stands between the user and a big mess. I think it would be much better if the cap opened when the mechanism was up. And sealed when pressed down. The cap works backwards. If the cap opened when up the contents of the bottle would not need to pass through the cap.",Kindle Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de febrero de 2020
Really Works!!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a terrific product! I am staying in the hospital with a child and wanted easy access to hot tea.

On Friday, I preheated it as instructed, full of boiling hot water for 10 minutes, and then refilled it with hot tea. That was at around 3:30 PM. 16 hours later, the tea was still so hot that I had to wait for it to cool before drinking. Over 24 hours later, and mostly drained, tea is still very warm.

Wonderful for keeping beverages hot or cold,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I absolutely LOVE this Airpot and we used it multiple times while we were out. It is so easy to fill with either a cold or hot beverage and take along a picnic.... It kept the hot drinks hot and the cold drinks cold for well over 12 hours. We really think this will be used in our house so much more than just for picnics and outings because we host a lot of family events during the warmer months and can't wait to use it for tea, lemonade or coffee. It's nice to have something to keep drinks whatever temperature we need for hours at a time. The swivel base will make it easy to access when on a table with other drinks and the adjustable spout helps from splashing especially with a hot beverage.

nice airpot,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I haven't owned or closely examined any other thermal airpots- but this Pykal airpot seems to work fine so far. Like all non-electric carafes/airpots, the fluid stays hotter for longer the more volume of hot liquid there is in the airpot. Because the capacity of the airpot is fairly large, hot water poured close to capacity will remain hot longer than with my 2 L Pkyal carafe. I have been very pleased with the 2L Pykal carafe, and find this larger one to be up to par. I have to admit the long black spout may not be the most attractive. I don't know what the basis is for the long spout, but there must be a reason- why use extra material if not needed? Needless to say, I have no problem with the looks, even though my daughter giggled when she saw it.",M. S. Lee,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de marzo de 2019
Excellent Airpot,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I chose this airpot over other brands because of its features especially the adjustable spout and swivel base. The carafe material seems sturdy and looks like it will last long. I have used the airpot twice now - brought it to an outdoor gathering in the early evening. The heat kept, even in the cold weather. I am very happy with this purchase. My only gripe is that using my boiled regular tap water leaves residue in the carafe and stem and makes it twice as hard to clean. A mixture of vinegar, baking soda, and water and some scrubbing did the trick (customer service recommendation). I have yet to try using commercial bottled water to see if it solves the residue issue. Overall, this is an excellent airpot.",Inspector Mills,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de noviembre de 2020
Pours like a duck with a hole in the lip but Hotter Than Heck!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",Doesnt matter if it stays hot 12 hours bc it will be empty before then but it certainly has stayed hot as heck from 8am until nearly 5pm and I have had instant oatmeal and several cups of tea with it. Not allowed electric kettles here at work but we have a hot spout in an upstairs breakroom. Filled the carafe up in the am and its still super hot with steam now at the end of the day. There is a slight “defect” in the pour. It splatters a little if you try to pour too fast and there is not possible way to get the last bit out without taking off the top and holding it upside down.

Initially, I didn't think the swivel base was necessary but it has made it that much more convenient where I can just spin to where I'm standing. The adjustable nozzle is great for preventing spills and splashes.

Keeps the heat if you preheat it.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",It is probably the best stainless steel carafe I ever used. I always preheat with boiling water before using. It keeps the heat longer that any other carafe I ever used and I used quite a few. I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to others. The only reason I gave it an overall rating of 4 instead of 5 is that after filling the cup it drips for a second or two. It doesn't splash but it drips.

It keeps our coffee nice and hot for several hours and I am confident that if we filled it with hot coffee after pre-heating it and didn't drink it for twenty four hours it would still be at an ideal temperature. I did use a therma pen instant read thermometer 24 hours after we had drank some so it wasn't filled to the recommended level and it was still at 140 degrees F.

Don't waste your money.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","What utter C rap. Worked fine for the first week. Then the pumping mechanism got weak. On my third cup it would only dispense about a tablespoon of hot water for every lpump. Then it just sputtered and splashed all around but the cup hot water and by the time I had half filled the cup, my wrist was hurting from pushing on the darn thing. I checked inside, wondering if gremlins had drank all the water, but no, it was still about half full. But still I kept using it because the water stayed hot for so long >10 hrs at first . Also, I had noticed the top of the airpot was warm. I figured heat escaped through there. So I put a hat on it. Worked to keep the water hot for a while longer (maybe I just imagined it. Who knows).
Well, it no longer keeps anything warm for longer than an hour. Thank goodness it has a handle because the outside wall of this thing is too hot to touch. I'm not kidding.
Until another airpot (this one vacuum insulated and costs an arm and a leg unfortunately) arrives from Amazon, I have to wrap the airpot and put a hat on it to keep the water hot for longer than an hour. Seriously, check the picture.

Hot Mess,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Hot mess perfectly sums up this product.

The short and sweet:

Pro:
It keeps drinks hot.

Con:
It sprays that hot liquid every time you click the top.

Full review:

I have worked from home due to Covid and my basement office is rather inconvenient for refills during morning meetings. I bought this to pour the pot in and keep me going through zoom fatigue. I will start by saying it’s great for keeping coffee hot. I have good coffee all day from this. The negative comes when you open the lid. It has a click top that is intended to make it easy to seal and then open for pouring. Unfortunately, that means it seals the pressure from the hot liquid built up. Every time you hit the button it sprays hot coffee. I’ve tried using an open hand to press the button but all that does is force it out the spout. I want to like this and it might not seem like the end of the world but the best way to explain is a wet fart.. it might not ruin anything but it is going to require some cleanup and it’s always inconvenient..

I would not recommend this product.",Joe,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de febrero de 2021
"Broken after 3 family events, won't pump anything","1,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used it 3 times. From day 1 it would drip when you finished filling the cup.

Would never buy this again,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",So disappointed in this carafe. I use it every day and every day I am annoyed by how it doesn’t work properly.

Keeps Drinks Warm But Received Damaged Product,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I ordered this Airpot in December and received it promptly. On the first use, I found the base that holds the spout was broken. I contacted customer service. They did immediately send out a new spout and base to replace the old one with. However, they accused me of dropping or bumping the pot since in their words, ""the nozzle does not automatically break like this unless it was bumped or took an accidental drop."" I am an honest person and would never have contacted them if the damage was my fault. When I replaced the new spout I found that the broken one had either been damaged in assembly or it had been returned damaged and resold to me. I had ordered a ""new"" item, not a ""used"" one.

Capacity is Overstated compared to Bunn. Ability to keep liquids hot is about 1/4 of claim.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","While I haven't measured either model to see if one accounts for headspace and the other does not, The stated capacity should 8 ounces less than our 3.8 L Bunn Airpot and able to at least come close to holding contents of our 30 cup percolator as our Bunn holds it with room to spare. No such luck. Also, even with preheating of the carafe, we found our coffee cooler than required to melt cream after 5-6 hours. Love the design, and wouldn't mind putting up with the fact we have to pour at least 20 ounces of coffee from the percolator into cups first. However, the fact it never kept coffee warm for 6 hours, never mind 24 hours is unacceptable. We never returned it as we got what we paid for.",P.

Many reviews said it keeps the hot beverages warm for long periods of time but I found it to quickly start to lose heat. I always warm it up before, leaving hot water in the vessel at least 20 min before adding hot beverage, but still doesn’t work. My Thermos brand thermos might not look as nice but keeps beverages hot for many more hours. Also I found that when taking the lid off to fill it up if there is already water in it, it can create pressure and the lid will pop when opening , dangerous and scary. Overall the look is nice and I would use is for serving hot drinks at a dinner but would not recommend it to keep beverages warm for a long period of time.",C N Bloom,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de diciembre de 2020
"After 5 months of almost daily use, can't avoid soapy water in our coffee","2,0 de 5 estrellas","We used this to keep perked coffee hot. It served that purpose. However, despite (or perhaps because of) meticulous hand washing, the lid has recently started to retain the soapy water we use to wash it. I think this involves the mechanism whereby user pushes down switch in lid to allow pouring. This feature is not worth it because after a few months, the lid starts to serve as a reservoir for soapy water that pours out into your coffee. This despite trying to shake out the soapy water, etc.",Jeffro,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de agosto de 2021

It's great if you want to drink it all RIGHT NOW,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This product earn three stars from me because it is indeed easy to clean, easy to use and it's durable. It comes with it's own brush which is quite sturdy and also a plus. I've never owned an airpot and was unsure how to use and clean it. The item comes with an insert for you to register it at their website and it says there is a video on how to use it, but all I could see were more and more instructions on how to register it. That's okay because one read-through of the written instructions and you're all set.

The problem I have with this is that since I have tea and coffee drinkers in the home, I do not want to use the airpot to hold either coffee or tea, but rather very hot water. I certainly want the taste of rich Bustelo in my delicate Jasmine tea. Plus in the long run it'll be much easier to keep clean if I put only water in it.

I put water in the airpot at 212 degrees (boiling). I immediately poured myself a cup of hot water, and it measured at 178 degrees. Not even 10 seconds had passed. About three hours later, I poured another cup of water and it was at 150 degrees. I believe this is how the product is described in the description.

However, you can't make a decent cup of tea at this temperature. I am particular about my tea, and I steep for 5 minutes at 205 degrees. Even the most delicate green tea must steep for 185 degrees for 5 minutes before it can be fully enjoyed. At 150 degrees, it will barely open my Jasmine pearls and by the time it has been sitting for 5 minutes, it's too cold. The same goes for coffee. It's fine if you want to pour and drink right away, but who does that? You get a very hot cup of coffee so that you can sip and enjoy.

I never use tea bags (only full leaf, loose tea) but for the filings and shavings that most teabags use, 150 degrees is probably okay. However, for hot water (hotter than the tap) fast, it's a good dispensing product. There is no splash, and you have to use a standard size mug that fits underneath.",Posh Gypsy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de abril de 2019

Pretty Much Does WhatIt Says,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",The Thermal Coffee does a good job of keeping coffee hot. We haven't tested it with an actuall thermometer but it works best and longest if you fill it pretty much full. Once you start pouring coffee the heat retention goes down with the liquid level. It's well made and the ThermaClick Lid works well. Over all we're pretty satisfied. The only disappointment is that it's made in China and not in the U.S.,Bluepushpin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de septiembre de 2019

Not hot for 24 hours,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","So, this is rated at 150°F for 24 hours. Well, that was not my experience. I pre-heated this thing with near boiling water to the very top and left it in there for about 15 minutes. I have tested a few French presses over the years so I got them all out and made coffee in all of them at once so the coffee would be hot and ready at the same time. I emptied the water and poured the coffee in this carafe. It was actually more than the carafe could hold, so it was completely full. I put the dispenser in there and took a tiny pump out to test the temperature. I kept doing this every couple hours. By the next day, at 24 hours, my carafe had dropped from 167.5°F when I started to 116°F. I only took out a small pump which barely covered the bottom of a pre-heated mug to test it. It was mostly full the next day still. Even at 116°F the coffee was still hot enough to drink, but still not what I was expecting.

Anyway, using and cleaning this is easy. The pump comes right out of the center for cleaning and then you just have to wash the empty carafe. They even give you a brush to use. My bottle brushes are much easier and clean better, but hey, free brush is nice. Rinse it out, put coffee in it, put the pump in and shut the lid. Done. I like that it locks so I can keep my kids from going over there and hitting the button a million times. The pour spout can move up or down to accommodate multiple sizes of cups or travel mugs. That is super nice in my opinion. It doesn't splash all over the place with the shallow mugs. I found this really easy to use and was nicer than having to lift and pour a heavy vacuum carafe. I have nerve damage in my hands so this was very pleasant. I would have given it 5 stars for this, but the fact that the temperature dropped so much I need to take one off. I am still happy with this and continue to use it daily.",MarathonMom,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de abril de 2019
Perfect for Large Parties,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","The SplashProof Coffee Carafe Airpot Dispenser is perfect for parties, BBQs and any other get together that has a large amount of people. It will hold 120 oz at any one time and keeps the beverage hot or cold for hours. It is important to know that this carafe is not for just a cup of coffee or two. When using you should start with the carafe being at least 90-95 % full with the liquid. If you don't fill it up adequately the heat escapes to the upper walls taking away the warmth where the beverage is. Directions state you should pour hot water in and let it sit for 10 minutes before pouring your coffee, tea etc in. This will warm up the inside of carafe which will keep the actual beverage you are serving hotter longer ( you can also keep cold beverages cold using cold water for 10 minutes).

There is a directional sheet that gives directions for using the carafe. The directions are given in words and pictures so it is easy to figure it out. You are suppose to clean the carafe after each usage to and not to let tea coffee or tea or any drink in the carafe for more than 24 hours. The cleaning process is my one concern. The lid area opens but does not completely come off. There are cleaning utensils included but you can't get your hand down into the carafe to wipe it dry . Water catches in the rim of the lid and because the entire lid does not come off you cannot turn it completely upside down.",Editor of Lillian's Diaries,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de febrero de 2019
Helpful for late nights,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","My husband and I drink a lot of coffee. It's not always feasible to keep the coffeemaker on all day and night. This airpot has largely eliminated the need to do so. Fill with hot water to prep it while you're brewing your coffee and replace when done. We've had hot coffee for the rest of the day and night. Very easy to clean as well. There is a lock that slides at the back of the lid where you press for dispensing coffee, this lock is easy to accidentally switch. If you have trouble pushing down the lid, that may be the reason.",Leigh,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de marzo de 2019

Product is high quality, and it looks exactly as pictured.

I had one problem with it...although it claims to keep it very hot, and almost all the other reviewers concur, mine just didn't quite cut it. Again, as the outlier among reviewers, perhaps it's user error somehow?

Better than expected,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this as opposed to others because of the stainless steel interior and exterior. I have had other airpots and they have eventually broken or failed due to handling by others and weak construction. As I write this it is in use now and it works well and holds heat well. I was assuming that it would not quite measure up to a well made bottle simply because of the need to allow some air to intrude. That said it holds coffee hot for 12 or more hours which is all that I was looking for. I backed off construction to four stars because with the wrong people mishandling it; it is breakable, for me however it will likely last for many years to come.",Terry Houser,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de marzo de 2019

I cannot wait to use it for our next big family gathering and in the meantime, I like to use it in the mornings to leave hot coffee for my husband who wakes later than I do.

Good construction and great heat retention,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I use this Carafe for hot water and it provides great heat retention for at least 12 hours. The one thing to note is that you want to fill the carafe with at least 3/4 full and this should provide good heat retention. My only concern is the ThermaClick Lid that will most likely be the weakest link since it is the only mechanical part. My other concern is the lid being plastic and I hope there is no chemical leaking due to the high heat. Other than that, for the most part, it is stainless steel construction of good quality.
