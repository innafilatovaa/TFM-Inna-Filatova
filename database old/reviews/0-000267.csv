12 cup Culinary Stainless coffee pot,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",Our first stainless steel Cuisinart 10 cup Caraffe lasted for more than 10 years. We purchased the 12 cup model and are thrilled.

"Not bad, not great.","3,0 de 5 estrellas","It keeps the coffee hot and makes a good cup of coffee. The area where you pour the water is divided into two equally small areas so I have not filled it up once in four months without spilling at least a few drops of water. You really have to concentrate on pouring the water, and who wants that first thing in the morning? Furthermore, the spout sprays hot coffee when you’re pouring it from the carafe. The design doesn’t give you a nice straight, smooth pour. So that’s the second paper towel you have to use when making your morning coffee. The design from ten years ago was way better.",L.

Don't buy this. Buy a different pot.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Yeah, it works. Yeah, it has some good features. yeah, it's big and stainless pot. But, it's SLOW. And the pour of the coffee pot is HORRENDOUS!!!! With the lid on the pot, in ANY position the coffee pours out in 1000000 different directions and sprays everywhere! there is NO position that works. So you have to take the lid off every time..and even then it the pour is wild and in every direction. It's UNREAL someone designed such an awful pot and someone approved it and someone sells this POS. And the coffee pot is SOOO slow. Super disappointed in this Cuisinart.

"Doesn't keep coffee ""steaming hot"" for hours.","3,0 de 5 estrellas","It is misleading to say it keeps your coffee hot for hours. True, first cup is hot, but after 45 mins or so the next cup is lukewarm - have to use the microwave if you like it ""steaming hot"". It is difficult to pour. It pours very slowly, and you don't know how much coffee is left unless you open the carafe. Also, to fill with water is very tedious, hard to see the gauge if you have it in the corner of the counter top - have to slide it to the side to see it.
I am returning, and reordering the Cuisinart I've used for years - makes a whole pot, you can disperse one cup at a time, has a gauge on the front showing how much coffee is left, and it's easy to fill.
That's what I get for trying something new - stick to what you know.",Murph1,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de julio de 2024
Not for me,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Went by all the positive reviews but had to return it. It was too awkward to pour coffee out of it due to the design - almost had to tip it upside down to get it to just trickle out.

My favorite appliance,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I LOVE my coffee maker and I have zero regrets making the switch back to a percolator. I used a Keurig for 10 years and when my machine broke I decided to go back to a more conventional coffee maker. I am so glad I did, I have used this appliance everyday for the past 16 months and it still works great. I had to descale once in this time period with vinegar due to my hard water. You can brew 12 cups of coffee in about 5 minutes and the coffee remains pipping hot for at least 5 hours thanks to the stainless steel carafe. I would definitely purchase another Cuisinart coffee maker. The only issue I have with this one is I find it hard to clean the inside of the carafe due to the shape of the opening.",Aly B.,Revisado en Canadá el 8 de julio de 2024
Doesn’t keep coffee warm,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I read tons of reviews on various coffee makers and thought we were getting a gem because we had tried this coffee maker at a friends house. However 2 of these makers later it still doesn’t keep coffee warm or hot hours later like it should, and it is messy to pour and 1-2cups go unused as it is difficult to access.

This morning I made 8c and within less than 2 hours, the last 4 cups were less than lukewarm. I had to microwave the last 2 cups as they were cold.

It also makes a weird clicking sound when it is brewing. It sounds like there is a broken part ticking around in it whenever it brews.

Needs Improvement,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","While the coffee maker is clearly built, well, the major issue is the carafe, First, the lid has a pouring port that clearly needs to be redesigned, Since you have to tilt the carafe almost 90° before it starts pouring, and the poor is very weak. Second, the inner gasket and lip to the top of the carafe traps water. When you clean the carafe and turn it upside down that water never drips out and drains. It takes a lot to finally dry the carafe in preparation for your next use. The features and functions are good, and the coffee is good, but let’s just say I would never buy a second one.",Aerin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de junio de 2024
Very bad design,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","We have had this maker for 2 years now, so that's good. The coffee timer works great. The coffee stays hot, and is decent using the extra strong button. With that said there are 3 very bad design flaws that pretty much out number anything good. 1. The carafe is pretty much impossible to clean unless you are a child, an adult hand cannot get into the opening to clean the entire surface. 2. The opening provided to add water is at the back of the unit and the lid and the lid hinge give very little space to add the water. 3. That max fill line, it is true max you cant overfill past that line, if you do it will overflow out the back. This is not hard to do because you are trying to watch how your pouring the water in.

The photo is a year later. I’m ok with the design in general as it makes hot coffee and the carafe keeps it warm for hours. It’s a messy pour unless you’re okay taking your time as it trickles out of the pot.

Sure does keep the coffee hot!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","After reading the Amazon reviews, I had a concern about how long the coffee would stay hot - or at least warm! We were replacing a Cuisinart, so we know the brand is one of the best and went ahead with the purchase based on our Cuisinart past. One day, prepping for the next days coffee, I accidentally hit the Auto Brew button and it defaulted to 12:00am -- aka Midnight. Woke up around 12:15am to the smell of coffee brewing and laughed at myself and went back to bed. 6-7 hours later I got out of bed and the coffee was hot! Well, very warm to hot. Pleasantly suprised, I enjoyed my morning coffee. Thanks Cuisinart!",Joseph P. Finn,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de junio de 2024
Horrible design,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","We loved our old Cuisinart coffee maker but made a big mistake discarding the old one before buying this. Whoever designed it never took it home and tried to make coffee. It's nearly impossible to fill it using the carafe because the lid on the reservoir is in the way. The place where you have to put the water is tiny and easy to miss. We ended up buying a funnel to help us fill it. The carafe is also horrible. It leaks when you pour the coffee, so we're always having to wipe the countertop after pouring.",Paul,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de junio de 2024
The engineer who designed this carafe needs their iron ring taken away,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","The overall coffee maker works fine to brew coffee and the carafe keeps the coffee fairly hot. However, there are some major design flaws that make using this a hassle.
1. The carafe has a lip inside that means it doesn’t drain completely when pouring water in the basin or emptying the coffee
2. The carafe lid leaks a little on every pour no matter how you hold it. I can reduce the problem by removing the cap before pouring
3. The lid on the basin opens straight up and down, but because of issue 1 and the width of the carafe, it makes it so you can’t pour the whole amount of water in without making a mess or using another container to fill it

If these issues were resolved then it would be a good coffeemaker. As it is, the previous one I had from Cuisinart was far superior in design",Lemon Lover,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de junio de 2024
Love the Fresh Taste of our Coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Very nice coffee maker. After decades of owing ones that use a hot plate to keep the coffee warm, this aluminum carafe keeps our coffee warm for hours without burning the coffee into an undrinkable mess!
The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is the fact that the carafe does not itself have a way to measure the cups of water to be added, and, pouring the coffee into your cup is a bit slow and spatters a bit. Otherwise, it’s the best we have ever owned.",Krissy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de junio de 2024
Faulty carafe design,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This machine looks nice and makes good coffee, and it stays nice and hot. But the carafe is a really poor design.

Great coffee maker!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Particularly like the carafe. It keeps coffee warm all day without using any energy, and it pours without dripping.

It will leak the excess onto the counter.",Gordon Jones,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de junio de 2024
disappointing product,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee is a good example of a disappointing product from an otherwise leading brand in kitchen appliances.

We missed our window to return the unit and are now stuck with one we won't use. Looking for other options now.

"Not for me, thanks for the return","2,0 de 5 estrellas","The only reasons I’m even giving 2 stars instead of 1 is I possibly maybe could have found this out prior even if not exactly spelled out in the description and it was well made and did make good tasting piping hot coffee…for that first sip of the first half cup.

I never realized this coffee maker was designed to shut off with no carafe heater the second it’s done brewing. Apparently the pot is supposed to keep it “nice and hot” but, didn’t do it for me at all. That was a deal killer. Poured that pot in to my old maker and began my return process Instantly.

As I was cleaning everything the pot was difficult to really wipe clean like I usually do. Couldn’t imagine doing that daily, had to let it air dry to fully dry out. All that just wasn’t a combo for me. I really do like very very hot coffee whether it’s -10° or 75° in the morning. If I’m going to drink 2 cups I make 4 to constantly pour out a touch and top off regularly. It’s all part of the “jolt” I look for out of my morning coffee. After the first cup right after it was barely done brewing, every top off I was then tossing in the microwave for the heat.

I actually thought it was defective until I read more and in a review came across a line that stated it simple, “It turns off after done brewing.” Just retuned and ended up buying a similar Cuisinart coffee maker that does stay heated which has done me well.",Johnny,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de junio de 2024
12cup coffee maker,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought this to replace the 10 cup version I had for 10 +years. It makes good hot coffee the bold feature is nice , do not see all that much of a difference in all honesty I’ve only used that feature once. The thermal carafe keeps coffee hot/quite warm for some time, as did my old one. If you do not have enough room underneath cabinets you will probably need to pull it towards the front of your countertop to open the water fill and coffee basket. Since I am the only one who drinks coffee most of the time 12 cups is a little large. Brew time is good.
The reasoning for 4 stars, you are unable to get your hand inside the carafe to clean it need to use some type of a brush, poor design on Cuisinart’s part but I already knew that.",DeeJ,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de junio de 2024

COULD BE BETTER,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","The most important feature of a high-end coffee maker is whether it brews good coffee, and this one earns high marks in that area. It's the little things though that bug me about this product. Specifically, once the coffee is brewed the ""On"" light goes out, so you don't know whether the hot plate is keeping the pot warm...Nothing in the instructions advises about this so I don't know if this is intended or, a malfunction. I had to go on the internet to find out that the default is 2 hrs...
Secondly, the handsome stainless-steel carafe is awkward to pour and when you get down near the bottom you have to turn it completely upside down to pour the remaining coffee but you'll never get all of it out...Ditto for rinsing water out of it during cleaning.",Lonesome Bull,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de mayo de 2024

Excellent Brewer of Flavorful Coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I am a long-time user of a Bunn Speed Brew machine. After years of loyal service it went to heaven to play in the fields with other coffee makers. And when you love coffee as much as I do and have used the same machine for a long time, deciding on a new one is a bit like getting divorced and learning how to date again.

I knew I didn't want another Speed Brew. As much as I loved that machine I was always a little uneasy about the fact that it kept water hot in an internal tank at all hours of the day and night. I wanted something different.

A big selling point for me on this model is the thermal carafe. It was unlikely I would have settled on a machine with a glass carafe and a heating element. This carafe is not quite as efficient as the Bunn thermal carafe but it definitely keeps coffee piping hot for about 2 hours. If I use coffee from it after that I generally will pour a cup and warm it in the microwave for 30 seconds.

It has a 12-cup capacity, which is nice if I'm sharing. In the obscure language of Coffee Making 1 cup is equal to 5 ounces, so the maximum capacity of this brewer is 60 ounces. I typically brew 50 ounces using 14 tablespoons of medium coarseness ground coffee for a very flavorful result. For 60 ounces I use 16 ½ tablespoons. I try to aim for approximately a 17-to-1 ratio of water to grounds. I notice on the uncommon occasion that I brew 60 ounces, the water sprayer has to be cleaned of coffee, but I don't think the machine was designed for quite that much grounds.

When I brew 50 ounces of water (10 ""cups"") it takes 9 minutes on the normal cycle. I have not tried the bold brewing mode because the way I make my daily pot of coffee tastes excellent so why mess with it.

The brewer includes a reusable gold tone coffee filter. It also includes a small bundle of paper filters. But I have been consistently using the reusable filter with excellent results. I was reading that there are some beneficial chemicals in coffee that are potentially filtered out with paper filters, and I really enjoy the flavor of my coffee using the reusable filter so I see no reason to buy paper filters.

The panel lights are a bit bright. The other night I was in the kitchen with the lights off and I was surprised at how much light the machine was giving off. But that's really nothing to complain about.

As a fussy coffee drink who spent so many weeks reading and re-reading review after review of machine after machine, I am quite happy that I landed on this machine. It comes with my recommendation, for whatever that's worth. 🙂",CNYGamer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de mayo de 2024

Good Coffee Maker,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I have used this model for 2 weeks now. It makes good coffee, it looks nice, and it is easy to program.

1. I did read reviews for it before I purchased it. The 1 feature mentioned often in the reviews was about the length of the electric cord. It IS very short. Plan on having it Right At the Outlet. Cuisinart should spend a dime more and lengthen the cord.

2. It is nice to have options for filtering coffee. A gold filter is included. I could not tell that the gold filter did a better job than the paper filter. It is a mess to clean up. And, to me, it doesn't make the coffee taste better. The paper filter works best for me.

3. I did not see anything in the reviews I read about filling the water reservoir. The insulated carafe must be turned upside down, All the Way Upside Down, to empty out all of the liquid. This is not user friendly for filling the reservoir. If you put in the coffee filter and coffee and Then add the water, you will have a wet filter of coffee. Depending on how much water you spill into it, you could have a coffee drip started. So don't use the coffee carafe. Find a proper sized pitcher and fill the water reservoir first. Then add the filter with coffee.

4. I have not cleaned it yet, just rinsing between uses. So no review on the cleaning aspect.

5. I do like this coffee maker. I must say it makes good coffee. The water temperature is not so hot it makes the coffee bitter; it's not so cool it doesn't steep it properly. The carafe keeps the coffee nice and hot over 2 hours. I never have any left past that time.",Gail,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de abril de 2024

"Love this coffee maker! Great tasting, very hot coffee","5,0 de 5 estrellas","Update: The first one I bought lasted about 19 months. The price has increased almost 50% since I bought that one. When it died I tried a few other models that are less expensive. After a day or a week I returned those and ultimately bought another one of these. I’ve had my second one about 11 months now. I will likely never buy anything else. Best coffee I’ve ever been able to make at home. It used to be if you bought something from Cuisinart you could expect to still have it in five years. I wish that was still the case, but if I’m being completely honest I would buy a new one of these every year if I have to.

I looked at every model of thermal carafe coffee maker and read a lot of reviews before choosing this one.

This is, by far, the hottest coffee I have ever gotten from a home coffee maker. For me, this is a huge selling point.
The thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot enough to enjoy without microwaving for at least 4 hours. Even after 6 or 7 hours the coffee is still warm and tasty. Because it does not use a warming plate to keep the coffee hot, the last drop of coffee tastes as good as the first. I will never go back to a glass caraf. I like the flavor of my coffee better than I have with any other coffee maker I've ever owned.
The carafe is large. It holds almost 2 liters if you fill it to the 12 cup mark.
The pour spout is designed specifically so It doesn't dribble all over the place when I pour.
It makes the coffee pretty quickly. Speed depends on the settings you use and, obviously, how much coffee you're making. A full pot without the bold setting is read in about 11 or 12 minutes.
It is completely programmable so you can setup the coffee to be ready at whatever time you'd like. It also has a ""1-4"" button for if you're making 1 to 4 cups of coffee, and a ""bold"" button if you like stronger coffee. Those two buttons have a similar function. They slow the water flow over the grinds so you get the full flavor in a small pot, or a bolder flavor in any pot.
A note about pouring because I've seen some reviewers that didn't like how the pot pours. I don't use the pot to fill the reservoir with water. I did that the first time and it pours way too slowly. That was aggravating. That may be why others complained. So I use a plastic pitcher for filling the reservoir. It appears that the top to the pot is designed to control the flow rate when pouring. I see this as a positive. When I'm filling my coffee cup I'm never wishing it would pour faster. I'm just glad coffee isn't getting all over the counter, the floor, or me.

I noticed some reviewers said the buttons stopped working after a few months or a year. I will say that it doesn't take much force at all to get a response from whatever button you push. Because of those reviews I make a point of not using much force when I hit ""Brew"" or whatever button I'm pushing. If you poke them hard over and over, I could see them not working anymore after awhile.

This coffee maker looks nice in my kitchen. If you have stainless steel appliances it will match. It takes up a very reasonable amount of space on my counter. The measurement lines are on the right side in the middle; however you can pour the water into the reservoir from either side. The reservoir is the whole back of the unit and is accepts water on either the left of the right side.

The filter basket is cone shaped. It comes with a gold screen reusable filter insert. I still use a paper filter in that as well because I don't like any sediment in my coffee. The paper cone filters cost a little more than standard filters but not so much that it is deal-breaker for me. A few extra dollars every 3 or 4 months.

You have the option to use a charcoal water filter, but if you never use one it doesn't change how to unit performs. The charcoal filter's purpose is to filter things like the chloriine flavor out of your water. I use it.

Some reviewers complained that the instructions are lacking in detail. Maybe the manufacturer has updated them since then. For the most part the setup is all pretty logical. The one thing I found difficult to figure out and not explained in the instructions was getting the charcoal filter into the filter holder. Turns out it is apparently so easy it looks hard. I included a few pics. On the stem portion of the charcoal filter holder is the word ""open"" with an arrow pointing downward. Right below that on the base is a little notch that sticks up. Just gently pull on the little notch and the front of the base flips open. The back left corner of the water reservoir has a slot cutout in the bottom to hold the base of the charcoal water filter setup. You just gently set it down in there. You don't have to force it. And it stays in place. The last pic is of the cutout in the bottom of the water reservoir. Other than that setup was really easy. The filter basket only fits in one way. It's a no-brainer to see where the water goes. The instructions tell you how to use all the buttons and features.

There is a ready tone that beeps 5 times when the coffee is finished brewing. It's pretty loud. If you don't like that, you just press the ""Tone"" button near the clock face and the ready tone is off.

It comes with one charcoal water filter, several cone shaped paper coffee filters, and a coffee scoop. Amazon sells the charcoal filters and the paper cone filters for very reasonable prices.

I've been using this coffee maker since the day after Christmas 2019 and I have no complaints. I will update this review if anything changes. I've had a Bunn, and several models of Hamilton Beach over the course of 20 years. So far, this is the best coffee maker I've ever owned.",DavidsGirl,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de enero de 2020
Overall Pretty Good Machine!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This machine has pretty much any feature you could ask for. Pros: Looks beautiful on my counter, it's not overly large and the stainless steel compliments my other appliances. Very simple to use, especially when programming your coffee for the morning. I like the fact that after the coffee brews you have an alert sound in which you can choose to turn off or on. Very easy to see the water level on the side when pouring the water in. Coffee is very hot when brewed. Coffee carafe keeps coffee hot for quite sometime. I left coffee in the carafe over night and it was still lukewarm the next day. Cons: When pouring the coffee from carafe you have to practically turn it up side down. You must pour slow or the coffee will spray all over. In order to clean the pot you'll have to get a scrub brush as you can't fit your hand in the carafe. Overall the pros out weigh the cons. I'm definitely keeping this machine it's make a great cup of coffee!",KIMBERLEY A WALSH,Revisado en Canadá el 5 de diciembre de 2022
great coffee maker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is my second thermal carafe model as the old one finally died after about 11 years of problem free continuous use. I really like the new model as it can make 12 cups instead of the old 10 and the display and control buttons are large and easy to read. I also like the see through window on the side of the machine so you can more easily see how full the water reservoir is. The old model didn’t have that feature. Some of the other reviews mentioned a few complaints and I can address some of them so that you can operate the coffee maker without any negative issues. If the carafe lid is not screwed on fully it will dribble when pouring and make a mess. I also found it sometimes gets hard to tighten the lid fully which just adds to the problem, so I just rubbed a tiny bit of cooking oil on the tip of my finger around the rubber seal and it seals smoothly and perfectly every time- no more dribbling coffee while pouring. Another review mentioned you can’t pour out all the coffee out of the pot, but don’t worry: You never have to lose any coffee. When you are down to the last bit of coffee just unscrew the lid and pour every last drop into your cup and use that as an opportunity to rinse the pot- you'll need to rinse the pot anyway, and why dump perfectly good coffee into the sink? Also, make sure you rinse out the lid: if you don’t, coffee residue can build up inside. And although years ago I used to use the glass carafe to pour water into the coffee maker, the thermal carafe isn’t very efficient for filling the reservoir. I solved the problem by keeping a plastic pouring container by the coffee supplies in the cabinet to do it. It's easier that way rather than spilling. I hope this one lasts me another 11 years.",owlristotle,Revisado en Canadá el 21 de abril de 2019
Great & compact coffee maker!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Loving this Cuisinart. Great coffee, great settings, great window to accurately add water, carafe is slick design that you dont have to fiddle with buttons or paddles or anything else. A valve in then lid lets the coffee in as it brews, and cleverly opens only once you tip the carafe to pour. Does require patience though as the rate of pour is glacial and can sputter a little making a mess. But coffee remains hot for at least 3 hours if you preheat the carafe, and of course it's never burnt like a heat element might be. Water filters are easy to source and replace, and the permanent filter does a great job giving me all the flavors and oil without any of the grounds. As with any fine mesh you will get a bit of residue, but not bad at all. So glad I chose this model!",Kevin,Revisado en Canadá el 8 de agosto de 2019

Updated: Impressed...Day 1 Review,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","So this is a day 1, first impression review. Will update later if needed.

Got the this stainless steel 12 cup thermos style unit last night. Set it up this morning. Easy peasy. Beautiful machine. I love that the inside is all stainless and there is no coating in the carafe.

After the initial setup, doing the suggested 1 pot water only run, and then brewing a pot of coffee, this one seems like a keeper. I love the reusable filter basket. That was a requirement for any maker I chose. It brews a full pot quite quickly. There is not mess or extra drips when you pull the pot out mid-brew. The pour is neat and tidy without splashing and slopping everywhere. And my coffee stayed nice and HOT in the carafe all day, without the heating element being left on. I made the full pot at 10:00 and when I came for a half cup pick me up at 5, it was still steamy! What? Heck yes! As a homeschool mom, it is nice to think I could actually have a hot cup of coffee whenever I have a minute to myself. Also, the outside of the carafe stays cool to the touch.

I'm super impressed with everything about this machine so far. Hoping it lasts a good, long time!

UPDATE: Unfortunately, I have begun the return process one week in. I like the other things I posted before, but there is an AWFUL problem with grounds overflowing the basket and getting into the carafe. I mean, a LOT of grounds.

Also, I never really saw a lot of coffee on the plate, just a drip or two, but when I wiped it with a paper towel, it was just completely coffee covered. And when I wiped the rim of the plate, the materials of the maker shifted enough that my papertowel went between the rim and the base plate, and LOTS of moisture was getting on the paper towel. I finally gave up trying to dry it out. No wonder there are so many pictures of rusted bases. It probably just seeps down into the unit that way. So I'm returning mine while it is still in the return window and maybe just going back to my trusty French press.",NeedlessName,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de marzo de 2022
Great coffee maker. But…,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I guess I have to add to this review, rather than writing a new one. So, my previous Cuisinart coffee maker developed a leak, possibly in the tubing inside which caused extensive rusting to the various clamps and screws inside the unit and resulted in water leaking out onto our cabinet. Rather than do without one, I ordered a ‘new’ coffee maker from Amazon, which was classified as ‘open box’.
I was surprised to see, upon receiving it today, that the box wasn’t open - it was gone! The coffee maker was stuffed into a plain cardboard box with minimum packing and no documentation at all, not even warranty information. Having said that, it did arrive undamaged other than a few scuff marks.
I think you can do much better, Amazon, particularly when you sell an item for only slightly less than an ‘unopened box’ version.

Most everything is good with this coffee maker. My only gripe is that the last cup or two are difficult to pour from the carafe. You end up having to hold the carafe past vertical, causing the last bits of coffee to sputter out of the lid.
Other than that - great!",Eric,Revisado en Canadá el 18 de octubre de 2019
"Good looking machine, great tasting coffee, and POURS JUST FINE","5,0 de 5 estrellas","This review is for the DCC-3400 machine with a thermal carafe. This machine makes great tasting coffee, has simple intuitive operation, does not take up much space on the counter, and is *really* good looking. I recently purchased this to replace a similar Cuisinart model that I had for over 12 years. And the previous one was still working fine - it had just gotten dingy after daily use for so many years. I prefer using a thermal carafe because I usually stretch a pot of coffee over several hours, and coffee gets a burnt taste when heated for that long with a heating plate. The primary advantage of the thermal carafe (besides looking really nice) is that it keeps the coffee hot through insulation of the carafe, and not by continuously heating the carafe. So there are three things you need to know (1) the plate that it sits on does not heat up, (2) coffee in the carafe is going to lose heat over the course of a day; that is physics and it's unavoidable. However, it loses heat at a very slow rate. The coffee remains hot for several hours throughout the morning after it has been brewed, and even by the afternoon I would call it very warm - that's 9-10 hours after it was brewed and would be burnt coffee sludge if it were directly heated for that long, and (3) the lid is designed to maintain a seal that reduces the rate of heat loss, but you don't have to twist or open anything to pour a cup. For this reason, the coffee pours more slowly than if the spout were just open. But honestly, the difference is along the lines of taking 4 seconds to fill a cup instead of 2 seconds. I don't understand the claims in other reviews about spilling when pouring, unless they are turning the carafe upside down to try to make it pour faster. The spout pours just fine and I've noticed that this model actually pours a little faster than the previous one I had. If the spout were more open, the carafe would lose heat more quickly. The only way to seal it further would be to design a lid that needs to be twisted open when you want to pour (like a thermos), and it would still lose heat at a faster rate every time you open it. I feel that the design of this carafe strikes the right balance between the seal needed to retain heat and ease of pouring. Another bonus is that the carafe does not need to sit in the coffee maker to stay warm - when serving coffee to a group I can keep the pot right on the table or wherever is most convenient. A thermal carafe may not fit the bill for everyone, but if you need a pot of coffee to stay hot for several hours without eventually tasting burnt, I highly recommend this machine.",Jen B,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de marzo de 2018

"Good machine, a couple negatives.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","It makes a great hot cup of coffee. Easy to use, good features- like the 1-4 cup option makes it hotter and slightly bolder. My wife complains that the lid on the thermal carafe has areas impossible to reach for cleaning thoroughly- without a small brush. This is 100% true so all the 5 star reviews are from Cuisinart lovers who can't see a negative. Another large x is you need super tiny hands to get through the top of the carafe if you want to scrub it. Or you need a dedicated brush on a wire. Or you can put it in the dishwasher every night, but how do you do that if you want to preset your brew time for the first stroll into the kitchen?

"tidy footprint, keeps warm several hours","4,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee maker takes some doing.
You may not notice it at first, but when you lift the lid, the condensation runs not only into the well but also down to the hinge and tiny ledge at back, from which it drips worrisomely along the cord area and then onto your counter. You must wedge a thin cloth behind the hinge as you open it and simultaneously dry the other side with another cloth, and then repeat this maneuver a couple of times.
The lip of the carafe is ingeniously designed so that the coffee fairly leaps forward in a neat parabola as you pour—until you reach the bottom of the pot, at which point the coffee trickles out in every direction. But if you remove the lid and turn the carafe smoothly and completely upside down, it will pour out its last cup perfectly.
You can cut standard paper cone filters to fit, but because of the showerhead design, they will frequently fold over, wasting most of the coffee. So, instead, you must work out a routine for cleaning the reusable filter, which will clog your drain if you do not wipe the grinds out before rinsing it. On the considerable plus side, the reusable filter sports a flat bottom, making it easy to fill.
If you cannot count on a dishwasher load for the carafe, you will have to use a bottle brush to clean it: in order to provide a takeoff ramp for the leaping pour spout, the carafe’s opening has been constricted so severely that a hand can’t reach through, unless your five-year-old volunteers for the job.
So here are my recommendations to Cuisinart:
1) Make a 6- or 8-cup model, plenty for most of us, so that you can keep the small rectangular footprint but set the lid and water farther in, making it easier to pour water in and harder for water to get out.
2) Forget the thermos concept, with its tricky lid and spout design, and instead bring back the simple glass carafe and hot plate, and make it like the old models that stayed heated until you shut them off—via a huge back-lit button.
3) Forget the programmable brew time. Coffee making is a morning activity. Who wants extra chores and wakeful aromas in the evening? And who wants the possibility of accidentally setting off a programmable brew and then not being around—a much greater fire hazard than a simple on/off hot plate.
4) Ditch the LED display and special functions. I do thank Cuisinart, a thousand times over, for providing that mute button, but why do you need the beeps in the first place? Everyone hears the distinctive belch of a coffee maker when it’s done. All we need is one big bright Brew button.
In the meantime, this Cuisinart model has the smallest footprint available for a nice brew that will stay heated for a number of hours.",Wienke,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de septiembre de 2023
"Makes yummy coffee, but for 8 cups, not 12…This makes my second. I would not buy it again.","3,0 de 5 estrellas","(This machine is Stainless on the outside, but black plastic on the inside unfortunately.)
Everything has gotten so expensive, I have been finding ways to reduce our expenses. With this coffee maker, we only need to use half the ground coffee our old machine used, and with the Bold option, we actually get MORE flavor than before. we also love the option of stealing a cup while the coffee is brewing, but dont expect that cup to be very hot if you steal it too early in the process. The coffee is hotter when the brewing cycle completes, at which time it chimes Complete.
This machine makes truly delicious coffee if you allow for its quirks, but if you overfill the cone with coffee grounds, its just one big mess. This is my second machine of this model….so, my advice,
Get rid of the reusable filter. It does not hold enough ground coffee to brew anything other than a cup of water. We Use a large Bunn paper filter. It holds a lot of coffee. Leave about an inch of space or more from the top to keep the brew cycle from overflowing. If you like a good strong brew, always select the Bold option and dont make more than 8 cups at a time. We tried a pot without Bold on, and it was just water. no flavor.
The programmable feature is so easy to use, I didnt even need the instructions.. Set the clock. Then program the time you would like the coffee to be ready. It is a wonderful feature. And the best thing about this fantastic carafe is that the coffee stays fresh and hot for hours if you leave the carafe in the machine.
The carafe is well built. You dont even have to turn the lid to pour a cup, but I pour the first cup over the sink. Its drippy if you pour soon after brewing.
And we love being able to steal a cup mid-brew.
We always rinse the lid, carafe and black cone after use, to keep them clear of grounds. It is a lot of work, and I will not buy another one when this one dies…too much mess and maintenance.
Important Note: We used Seattles Best in our old coffee maker for four years. But it had no flavor in this machine. Then I remembered we always have to change coffees when we change coffee makers. The best coffee We have found so far for this machine is Starbucks medium or blonde roasts. Target almost always seems to have coffee on sale. We found Starbucks on sale there and stocked up.
More than once a week we use a clean moist cloth to wipe out the cone base. It tends to collect grounds, especially if the filter is too full.
Special Note: Soon after we bought this machine, my husband awoke one morning, and while still half asleep, stole a cup of coffee while it was brewing. In his groggy state, he neglected to return the pot to the machine, so hot coffee ran down the white cabinet, over the white drawers, down the white baseboard of our freshly painted, just completed kitchen. The entire front of all of it is now stained brown from coffee. 😵‍💫",Rainy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de octubre de 2022
Early assessment,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Yesterday I did this review giving this a one star rating, accusing it of being a leaker. I am now editing my opinion and this review, since upon better investigating, I learned that it does not leak. The culprit that was creating the moisture on the counter that I found as I pushed it back into place, is the lid. The brewing process creates a lot of moisture or condensation on the lid, and when raised to empty the coffee grounds, some of that moisture can run down the back of the maker. I verified that by holding a paper towel on the back while raising the lid. So the maker at least right now (it is two months old) does not leak and the issue with the moisture from the lid is easily caught and prevented from making it to the counter. Some other reviewers have fussed about the carafe being difficult to empty when filling the maker. I avoid that issue by falling back on the old ""MR Coffee"" solution of providing a measuring device made for pouring and setting the proper amount, by using an 8 cup measuring cup to fill the reservoir and the 8 cup brings it just short of or right at the fill line. In my mind the only thing keeping me from the 5 star rating is the little issue with the lid.",Douglas G Sorrelle,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de septiembre de 2023
"My only negatives are personal gripes, I think","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I work at home and like to have hot coffee on demand throughout the morning at least. So, we were looking for a coffee maker that kept the coffee hot in the carafe for a long time. This one does that very well. The carafe holds the coffee at a seriously hot temperature for several hours. That's one plus.

This coffee maker has a ""bold"" button that supposedly results in a stronger brew. We always push it and we are satisfied with the strength of our coffee. I'm still a bit suspicious that it's all in our heads. I'm not sure what the machine actually does to embolden our coffee.

The carafe that does its holding-at-temp job well pours out at a leisurely pace, much more so than any previous coffee maker carafe we've owned. It's probably a good thing that the coffee maker wants me to slow down a bit first thing in the morning. But it does sometimes bug me that it sets the pace when I might be in a little more of a hurry.

This carafe is a solid, stainless steel item. So you can't see how much coffee is in it without removing the top. That's not such a big deal, except when you are setting up the fresh pot for the morning. You have to remember to make sure the carafe is empty or you could find an overflowing mess in the morning.

You might be thinking, don't you use the carafe to fill the water reservoir? We don't because unless the lid is off, it pours slowly, and its size makes it a clumsy fit over the water reservoir opening. So we use a separate container to fill it.

Finally, the thing has a beeping alarm to let you know your pot of coffee has finished brewing. It is loud and annoying, and thankfully you have the option of disabling it. I recommend doing that, especially if you set the timer to brew before you get out of bed. It will launch you out of bed for sure when the alarm goes off.

We've had it for a few months, and despite my few gripes, we are happy with it. I'm getting used to its differences from the classic ""Mr. C""-type coffee makers, and I truly enjoy the long holding time of hot coffee in the carafe through the morning.",T. E.

Good but not great !,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","We bought this in May of 2023 and use it almost daily. Just a couple of smaller things that aren't ideal. 1. The coffee doesn't stay super hot through the couple of hours we are drinking it. There isn't a full seal on the pot because the top where the coffee drips through seems to allow the coffee to cool down.
2. In order to pour the last couple of cups from the pot you practically have to turn it upside down which makes pouring it messy since you can't quite see the cup in reference to the spout.
3. Lots of steam comes out the back of the machine so we moved it from under the kitchen cabinets to it's own shelf. I was worried over time that the steam could impact the cabinet finish.",Gabriella,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de enero de 2024
There must be a better coffee maker!,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","For comparison purposes, my previous coffee maker was from Ninja. I do not recall what model. That coffee maker had mental health issues!

This is a middle of the range coffee maker. At best.

1) Referring to it as ""Perfec-temp"" is funny.

The coffee is hot but but hot enough. If you leave it on the burner for a while, then it is OK.

Which leads me to

2) The coffee was too acidic

When the water does not extract properly from the ground coffee, in this case under extraction, the coffee is too acidic or perhaps you prefer the term ""bitter""

This is one reason the end result is not hot enough.

One suggestion (I read somewhere) was ""use the BOLD setting).

If you like acidic mud, do that.

Another suggestion is grind the beans finer. So I grind them into dust. I even have to grind already ground coffee into dust as opposed to what is in the package.

Still muddy but less acidic.

3) The carafe is poorly designed

When you pour the coffee fro the carafe you will not get all of the coffee.

I brew about one large mug at a time. When I pour from the carafe, I get about 2/3rd's on what is in the carafe.

I have turned it completely upside down and shaken it to get more.

To get most, I take off the cover.

4) There is nothing in the instructions booklet about the ability to turn off the burner or how long it stays on.

At least nothing I found. It must use magic to determine that you have finished what is in the carafe.

I do not brew more than a cup or two at a time and never leave it on the burner for longer than it takes to bring it to the ""prefec-temp"" (sic)

5) Brew strength is more about how much coffee you put it as opposed to the regular default or bold. I think that regardless of how you like the coffee, put it what you want as opposed to using BOLD. Your mileage may vary.

6) The 1-4 button really makes little sense.

The booklet claims the ""technology"" adjusts the way it makes the coffee if you are making less than 5 cups.

Nah.

7) ""Programmable""

You press the program button to change the time and time if you want it to make the coffee at a certain time. That's all it does.

One video shows the ability to change burner temperatures. Not this model.

8) Cleaning

I have yet to run a cleaning cycle so I can't comment on that.

As far as cleaning the unit, the reservoir is part of the machine base and opposed to my Ninja mental case which had a detachable reservoir. Easier to clean. To clean this one, you need to get your hand in there. Good luck with that.

9) Charcoal filter

The booklet states the charcoal filter is provided to remove stuff from the water to make it taste better.

Easy enough to replace. Prepare to buy a lot since you will be replacing it every 60 days or 60 cups. For me, 60 cups is about two weeks.

Not likely I will be replacing it. I'd rather use bottled water than tap anyways.

I am buying the next level up from this brand. This one will be my ""spare"". It works. I don't love it. I don't want to bother returning it. The only reason I am buying another from this brand is I have yet to find any brand that I like for a variety of reasons.",gemachte,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de julio de 2020

It’s awkward…,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","The coffee maker is quality but there are a few design flaws.

It’s difficult to fill the water reservoir using the coffee pot.

It’s awkward to pour coffee from the coffee pot even if you unscrew the lid. The angle must be so great that you almost have to tip the pot upside down.

For whatever reason, even though we clean the pot thoroughly after each use and leave the screw too lid off it remains smelling of old coffee.

The glass version of this maker is better. We bought it because we broke our glass pot. And we thought it would be nice to brew into a thermal pot and not need to keep a burner on for x hours.

We used to have a Braun thermal pot and it was loads better. Sorry.

Oh and we have to do a small hot water pour over and let’s the grounds BLOOM a few minutes before turning in BOLD BREW. If we don’t the coffee runs through the grounds too quickly and the coffee isn’t as flavorful.",Laurie S.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de octubre de 2023
DCC-3400 is an excellent coffee maker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","UPDATE 3 September 2017
Nothing out of the ordinary to report. It's been 12 weeks (since 11 June) since the DCC-3400 was delivered to my house. During that period the coffee maker has worked flawlessly. I've neither seen nor experienced any of the early onset problems I've read elsewhere. I will say this; I only brew 10 cups of coffee at a time, since that's what I did for decades (with and without Cuisinart), and I just can't seem to break the muscle habit of ""ten scoops in the morning."" But I brew every single morning, and when I'm on travel, my wife brews just like I do.

Some habits I believe help:
- I clean the basket every morning, and don't let the grounds sit, even for a day.
- I wash out the pot at the same time I clean the basket; I don't let any coffee sit in the pot.
- I clean off the outside of the pot and brewer with a damp cloth at least once a week.
- I use pre-filtered water that flows through my refrigerator.

And that's about it. It works excellently and looks as good as it works, and it delivers excellently brewed coffee. It's still a five star purchase.

ORIGINAL REVIEW

I purchased this coffee maker to replace an older Cuisinart DCC-1150. The 1150 had been purchased back in 2007, nearly ten years ago. It had developed a very small intermittent leak in the base of the unit. It still made good tasting coffee, and I was hesitant to replace it, but I went on ahead and purchased the 3400. Here's the key points on this purchase:

1) I purchased this via Amazon Prime, and took advantage of their one-day free delivery offer. The 3400 was ordered early Saturday and arrived around 6pm the next day on a Sunday.
2) I ""brewed"" two full pots of water only through the 3400. The next morning, on the first official pot, the coffee tasted great.
3) I brew New England Coffee purchased at a local Publix.
4) I use filtered water filtered by my Kenmore refrigerator which is what I've always used with the older 1150.
5) This review is on the brand-new unit after the second pot of coffee.

The 3400 is more like a refined 1150. It's the same general size and shape, with the 3400 slightly larger to brew 12 cups vs. the 1150's 10 cup capacity. The 3400 has a veneer of stainless steel vs the black plastic exterior of the 1150. The 3400 comes with a stainless steel caraf, just like the 1150 did, but big enough to hold 12 cups. It brews coffee as fast as the 1150 did. What's interesting is how the 3400 has the same identical coffee basket and upper assembly that the 1150 has. Big flat buttons on the 3400 replace the smaller buttons and a knob found on the 1150.

Because the 3400 is more refined, pouring water into the coffee maker is actually easier with the 3400. The opening in the back is slightly larger. I can easily pour water into it without spilling any using a standard Rubbermaid two quart pitcher. When it's nearly finished brewing a small amount of steam comes out of the back vent holes, just like it did with the 1150. When the audible finished alarm goes off, the 3400 sounds just like the 1150.

The 3400 is an excellent coffee maker. It's well built, better even than the older 1150 (which was itself built quite well). It produces excellent coffee without the drama I've read about in some of the other reviews on this product. I highly recommend the DCC-3400.",W. H.

"Love it all, BUT....the problem we have is!","4,0 de 5 estrellas",When it was designed someone should have noticed that the lip in the carafe should have been notched to allow pouring when low level so you can pour it without spilling over the sides of the cup.,Rockin Robert,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de abril de 2024
Exceeds my expectations - Highly recommended,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","So, I read reviews etc. before settling on this coffee pot. My last one lasted 10 years or so until a button jammed and it quit working. That was a Kitchen Aid with a thermal pot, and I liked it. This review is relative to that machine.

Pros:
>>Thoughtfully designed and sturdy.
>Reliably makes great-tasting, piping hot coffee!
>Large pot (12-cup) which is great since we use an espresso machine for smaller servings.
>Thermal pot keeps the coffee hot for a long time!
>No need to turn the lid to open and close for pouring! This also means the coffee doesn't get cold when you forget to twist the lid shut after pouring your coffee; my last machine had that problem.
>Intuitive programming for auto-on and other features (unlike my last pot, which was confusing).
>Bright blue lights make it obvious when the pot is set to turn on automatically or when it is brewing, unlike my last machine.
>Looks great!
>Didn't overflow when I forgot to put the lid on the coffee pot. This is an awesome feature because in my previous coffee machine, this ended up as a counter-flood disaster! This machine allowed the filter basket to overflow INTO the coffee pot. Sure, the coffee had grounds in it, but the flood was averted.
>If you forget to seat the filter basket into the coffee pot, the lid to the filter basket and reservoir does not close all the way, so you instantly are aware of the problem, which would have caused my other machine to overflow.
>Coffee grounds bypassing the filter will not clog machine an cause a flood, as happened with my previous machine. This is the case for the same reason as the filter basket not seating properly does not overflow and cause a flood - overflow from the filter basket goes directly into the pot via the lid.

Con's:
I struggled to find a ""Con"" for this machine! I guess I can only say that I like when the other machine beeps at the start of brewing, and this one does not. No big deal really, and maybe offset by the fact that you can turn the ""beep"" function off if you don't want to hear it.

This is the best coffee machine I've ever had, and I have had several. I highly recommend it!",Jay,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de marzo de 2023
Great Coffee Machine,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This machine makes amazingly delicious coffee. It's easy to program with multiple settings, the coffee grinds smell delicious, and it produces strong, very hot, delicious coffee. I'm on my second one.
Pros:
-The coffee comes out hot. Much hotter than many other brands.
-It makes a strong tasting brew and never tastes weak or burnt.
-It does not have a bottom hot plate, and it doesn't need one. The stainless steel carafe keeps my coffee warm until I'm home from work, 10 hours later.
-Mine have lasted forever and replacement parts are affordable and easy to find.

Cons:
-It's a little loud when the grinder comes on in the morning. But on the plus side your house will smell amazing and you may want to get out of bed just for the coffee.
-It takes some cleaning, but don't listen to some of the reviews stating that it's a problem. You must clean the coffee grounds out of the shoot. I do mine everyday because it's easy and only takes a second. It comes with a small brush that fits perfectly into the slot and you can knock them right into the coffee ground basket. No mess. Very quick and simple. If you neglect this process, it will eventually clog that shoot and you'll get backed up grounds and weak coffee. Then it will involve more cleaning, but it's not like you have to disassemble the machine. Just use the brush and knock down the excess grounds and you'll be fine. Every self grinding coffee machine that I've read the instruction to requires this process.

This machine looks nice and brews delicious, fresh coffee that stays hot all day. It's not a $3,000 barista machine, but it's the best one in this price range. It's a great quality product. I would definitely recommend this product.",Mojoemil,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de octubre de 2022
Makes good coffee but has some awkward features,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I got this to replace my Cuisinart DTC-975BKN, which worked but I accidentally broke part of the carafe lid. It's been discontinued and I couldn't find a replacement part, so new coffee-maker it was. Overall I'm satisfied with the DCC-3400P1, but I don't love it.

CONS:

Pouring water into the top of this thing is an exercise in manual dexterity. For some reason it's designed to splash right back out if you don't aim just right. I gave up using the carafe itself to pour; it's just too hard to aim. I might get a funnel.

For some reason my thermos carafe version has a hot plate. I get that it's cheaper to make them all with the plate, but why leave it hooked up for the thermos versions? There doesn't seem to be a way to disable it with the controls. I don't think it's damaging the carafe but it's just a strange decision.

The beeps when it completes a brew are very, very loud. I can mute them, but there's no way to decrease their volume. The older model had much softer tones. I don't know why it needs to alert the neighborhood that my coffee's ready.

PROS:

The ""bold"" setting makes a difference and it makes really nice coffee.

The receptacle for the filter is well-shaped for paper filters. The DTC-975BKN was tight and I always felt like I was jamming the filter in, despite it being the right size for the machine. In the DCC-3400P1, it fits much better and I feel more confident about it.

The showerhead drip splashes back up much less than my older model. Cleanup is easier.

The carafe itself is much better designed than on my old DTC-975BKN. With the lid removed, the opening is nice and wide and I can get a scrub brush down in there easily.

It's a little thing, but after an auto-brew, the auto timer turns itself off. In my old model, it would stay active, meaning it would automatically try to brew a pot the same time the next morning, unless I remembered to turn it off. Nothing bad ever happened because of it, but I like not having to worry about it turning itself on ""dry"" if I'm not home.

Overall, it gets the job done. It just has some quirks and, IMHO, bad design elements.",Christopher Basken,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de abril de 2023
Small brews do not produce a good cup of coffee,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this in November 2023. Currently, I only need a small amount of coffee each morning. On the unit water measure, that's about a 4 which gets me about 16 ounces of coffee. My critical complaint - it just does not make good coffee. There are two helpful settings, ""bold"" and ""1-4"" cups. If I do not use either of these, coffee is very weak even though I'm using a large amount of grounds (way more than I've used on other machines). If I use the bold/1-4 buttons (one or the other or both), the coffee is stronger, it's just not very good coffee. It's bitter, as though it has been sitting in a pot for an extended period of time. I've used the same coffee for a very long time so I know it's not the coffee. I do not know how well this unit works for larger brews, but you're not going to get a decent cup of a coffee for smaller brews.

"Could be good, but...","3,0 de 5 estrellas","I was really looking forward to a new coffee pot and did a lot of research, read reviews and watched a lot of videos. As soon as it was delivered, I set it up because I wanted my new coffee maker to be ready first thing in the morning! I'm giving 3 stars just because I didn't make it past filling the reservoir for an initial cleaning run after unboxing and I have no idea how well it makes coffee, but that process alone was enough frustration and disappointment to box it back up for return. The machine looks great and the carafe is beefy with a lid that seals well. The controls are simple but provide a broad enough range of functionality that I'm sure it would be a good coffee maker *IF* it didn't have a couple of really glaring design flaws that combine to make the most basic parts of being a coffee maker a real problem. The heavy carafe makes using it to fill the reservoir difficult, plus there is a lot of trapped water in the bottom, so emptying it requires turning it completely upside down. Combine this with the really small area for filling AND the fact the lid won't move past 90-degrees vertical, it interferes with the ability to fill the reservoir. Also, the carafe pours...how should I put it...a little aggressively? It doesn't ""pour"" so much as ""stream"". So trying to hit that already-difficult-and-small reservoir fill target area is even harder. Finally, regardless of how slowly or carefully or using-both-hands-because-its-heavy method you use to try to fill the reservoir, because the grounds basket holder sits recessed with a gap all the way around, any spillage will bypass the ""stop and pour"" mechanism and flow directly down to the hot plate and your countertop. The lid I mentioned earlier? It traps extra liquid so that when you lift the carafe out of the machine, you'd better be careful because that freshly-brewed hotness has every chance of spilling off the top and on to your hand, countertop, fuzzy bunny slippers, etc. Returning and still on the hunt for a new coffee maker.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de julio de 2023
Great BUT one weird design flaw.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I have had this coffee maker for almost three years. I mistakenly bought it to replace the previous very similar Cuisinart coffee maker that HAD a built in grinder. That system worked for many years, but the grinder failed. My bad that I purchased one without a grinder, but I bought a grinder and all seemed well. The coffee is terrific, the vacuum pot holds heat well (I always pre-heat it) and the system overall works wonderfully well. ONE very small complaint. The place where the pot sits is base metal or some kind of rustable material. Since the pot is NOT heated by the plate beneath it there is no need for it to be metal. SHOULD be one piece plastic, as the previous machine was. AND because I am sloppy and water or coffee spill that base rusts. NOT a good feature!

"Unhappy With Carafe, Love The Coffeemaker","3,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a mixed review for me. I like the actual coffeemaker, but I am quite unhappy with the carafe.

I like thermal carafes and my former one was hard to clean, I could barely get my hand inside it, so when I saw this one which was much wider I thought it would be easier to clean. In all the pictures it looks like a wide top, however, the actual opening is only 2-6/16” across! I can’t get my hand inside this one. The top collar is designed such that it’s even difficult to get the last 1/2 cup of coffee out of it. In addition, to keep spattering down when pouring coffee it must be held at a certain angle. Whoever designed this carafe did not test pouring from it or cleaning it. I expected better from Cuisinart.

The carafe does keep coffee piping hot even 3 hours later, it’s attractive, and the handle is comfortable. That’s all I can say good about the carafe.

The coffeemaker unit I am pretty pleased with overall. Setting the time is easy but the directions never mention AM or PM. When I initially set the time it read simply 7:05 for example. It was not until nighttime that I noticed the readout now said 7:05 PM. So if you’re setting the clock time or auto brew time and it’s evening, you need to cycle through the time setting until you see PM, otherwise, your auto brew will not operate the next morning.

The base unit is attractive, the water fill & fill window are great, and the brew basket is easy to remove and rinse. I like that the “ready tone” can be turned off though it is not overly loud or long with the tone. I can set brew strength to my liking and it makes delicious coffee. Basically, I love the coffeemaker itself, it’s just the carafe should not only have been better described & photographed, but it should also have been much better designed.",Southwest Lady,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de julio de 2023
Several Issues,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee maker is just ok. It’s affordable & I mostly trust the brand so it’s probably a good buy but here are my complaints, in case it helps anyone.

The design of the pot is terrible! I have had tea pots before with this same issue. I don’t understand why people continue to make them like this. There is a curved lip at the top & it collects liquid. There is no way to pour out the very last remaining coffee without spilling it everywhere. I always throw out about a 1/2 worth.

And b/c of this issue, it’s never fully clean or dry. Even hanging upside down for hours, it won’t dry b/c water pools in that little lip so when you turn it back over, there is still water! The pot also doesn’t go in my dishwasher b/c it won’t situate between any of the prongs. So now I can only handwash a pot that won’t even fully clean or dry. It feels gross.

The buttons are too easy to accidentally press. If you even graze the machine & lightly tap the buttons, they will engage. One morning I did that & accidentally turned off the silent button. When it was done brewing, the beeps coming from that thing woke up the whole house! Why is the finisher alert so loud? I like that you can silence it but be careful!

While it does fit under my cabinets, it can’t actually live there b/c the steam it lets out of the top. It’s too close to the wood of the cabinet. So I have to pull that machine forward each time.

Overall, not impressed. I may try to see if I can get a new pot to go with the machine.",Tony,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de julio de 2023
"Looks nice, good coffee, but a little irritating.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought this to replace an ancient Krups, which I still miss because it was such a pleasure to use. This machine has very poor ergonomics, all the way 'round. As a unit, it has a nice clean appearance, and looks good on the counter.

But the carafe is very poorly designed, with a small opening and a persistent 'dead' volume that makes it difficult to empty completely, and hard to clean. Filling the coffee maker is awkward, both because of the carafe, but also because the reservoir fill openings on the top are an awkward, narrow, oddly-shaped afterthought - and it shows. Trying to fill the machine through its narrow opening using the bulky, hard-to-empty carafe is a daily aggravation. The filter basket is also poorly designed: It doesn't stand up on its own, but tips over, making it awkward to fill if you are grinding your own beans. If you resort to filling it where it is installed in the coffeemaker, then you risk having coffee in the machine, if you miss the funnel at all. And this is not an easy machine to clean out, should that happen. The machine's basic operating functions are standard and fine; No complaints there.

But in summary, this machine should be subjected to a blank sheet, thought-through design overhaul that takes its function and the daily routine into account and gives them first priority. Ergonomics are much more important than appearance.",Aggie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de abril de 2023

"Some quirks, decent overall","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Our old Hamilton Beach with stainless steel thermal carafe finally gave up the ghost after 12+ years; the plastic inside the lid was literally disintegrating. We have several other Cuisinart appliances and generally like them so we thought we'd give this a try. We also wanted something *without* a heating element under a thermal, stainless-steel carafe because the taste of burned coffee left atop a heating element is a big thumbs down for us. Overall, we like this unit because:
1. It seems well made
2. The carafe's opening is much wider than our old one, making it easier to clean
3. The carafe is super insulated and coffee stays hot a long time
4. The pause and our feature is nice, but see below
5. It's easy to program
6. Coffee is hotter than from our old coffee maker. Took a bit of getting used to.

Negatives:
1. Out of the box, it makes a really annoying beep when coffee is done brewing. Yes, there's a button to turn off the beep, but if you lose power or unplug the unit the beep comes back on by default. Our dogs made us aware of this by barking and howling when we unplugged and moved the coffee maker to a new location.
2. S l o w to brew, especially if you use the ""bold"" button. I suppose this makes sense, but ....
3. Pouring from the carafe is also annoyingly slow - really just a strong trickly instead of a decent pour stream. Almost *have* to open the lid and pour directly, because trying to fill multiple cups via pause-and-pour goes so slowly the coffee basket can overflow as water continues to be added over the grounds. The trickle also tends to spatter. We wondered if the lid needed to be turned for proper pouring, but this just seems to be poor (no pun intended) design.
4. The display's blue backlighting seems really cool - until you realize it's also super bright at night. Like, seriously, annoyingly, can't-look-right-at-it-when-coming-in-from-a-dark-bedroom bright. And there's no dimmer.",D. C. Blanchard,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de febrero de 2021

Others I have had had small access to those areas - this was great! No turning of the lid to pour coffee into cup when done and even with that, coffee stays HOT! The beeping at the end could be 1 or 2 beeps instead of 5 but no big deal really. Can use cone filters or regular ones and it comes with a water filter but I use filtered water to make coffee so that is not an extra feature I needed.

Having issues with coffee not brewing into the carafe,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this coffee maker for my husband in May 2023. He's not a coffee snob, so when asked for his review he said: it makes coffee. Plain and simple. However, twice in the past month, (and a few times before that) he's turned the coffee maker on, stepped away, and come back to a countertop full of coffee. He's a smart guy. He knows how to put the lid on the carafe, how to place it carefully on the burner, how to put the filter in with coffee, yet somehow the machine is just a bit too finicky and requires precise alignment. I've written the manufacturer. Maybe we have a defective machine. Hoping to get a replacement that will cause less of a mess.

Stainless carafe for the best flavor.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","It's too bad they mix these reviews up but this one is for the stainless carafe, DCC-3400P1 which we have had for 6 months. We started many years ago with the DCC-1100 then went to the 3200. The pots always made good coffee but by the end of two hours and several reheatings in the microwave the coffee would become bitter. We decided to try the carafe method and are so glad we did. We haven't had a bitter coffee since. If your primary interest is in the flavor this is the way to go. There are cons - the pot is heavier and you hand wash it. It doesn't pour as fast and you can't see how much is left. But as I said, if flavor is your main interest this is hard to beat.
One other advantage to this model is energy savings. I used a power meter to check the difference between a complete cycle on the 3200 and the 3400. The difference was .16kwh which over a year's time translates to 58.4kwh based on 1 pot a day. While doing this testing I learned that the 3200 hotplate only heats for about 15 seconds every 4 minutes so it was better on energy usage than I had thought.
I guess it comes down to convenience vs flavor; your choice.",Trout Fisher,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de enero de 2023
Almost perfect,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Well it arrived today. This unit is replacing a Keurig K-Cup machine we have had for many years. It was packaged well by Amazon. It was double boxed by Cuisinart (Colorful retail box inside of a brown storage box). Needless to say it arrived without damage.

Make sure you follow the ""Before Brewing Your First Pot of Coffee"" instructions which basically tell you to pre-soak the included water filter for 15 min in cold water then insert and run one pot of water through the entire machine to remove any factory dust from the manufacturing process.

The water came out at 171 degrees (see photo) which is pretty hot and the ""rain showerhead"" type water dispenser spout thoroughly soaked our freshly ground coffee in the #4 cone shaped paper filter even though it comes with a gold cone shaped metal filter.

Measurements: The machine shows 12 cups Max. on the water level indicator window. I put exactly 12 cups of water and measured the water in the pot which was exactly 8 cups using a measuring cup.

Measurements: The ""1-4 Cup Button"". Do not think that if you fill the reservoir with 12 cups of water and you hit the ""1-4 Cup Button"" that it will only make 4 cups of coffee leaving you a balance of water in the reservoir, it does not. While the manual does not fully explains this feature, I can only imagine that it somehow controls the application of the water to the coffee grounds.

Measurements: You need to figure out how much water to add based on how many cups you will need based on the size coffee mugs you use. My wife and I use our favorite cups which are different sizes so I had to figure out how much water to use for her 3 ""fills"" of coffee and my 1 fill. Not hard, just took some time and now we know exactly the amount of water to show on the level indicator before we brew.

Last point: While researching which replacement coffee maker to get, I read about the complaints by some about the residual amount of liquid left in the carafe after practically turning it upside down (see photo), about a quarter cup. A couple of shakes (with the lid secured) and it all comes out. Some possible room for carafe design improvements here.

All-in-all it makes a great hot cup of coffee.",Veronica B,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de junio de 2021
"Does everything well, but some trade-offs","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Got this coffee maker after dropping a glass carafe and was unable to find its replacement. Consequently, the metal carafe on this model seemed like a good choice and I liked the PerfecTemp feature. The metal carafe, however, is not well-designed. There's no indicator for how much water you have as you are fill it, and the spout is a poor design. Not only is it difficult to get all of the water poured into the coffee maker (always seems to be some left inside), but the carafe lip drips water down the front while pouring. I ended up using a glass carafe instead, but the warmer plate does NOT WORK AT ALL unless you are using the original metal carafe. So my second cup of coffee is always cold. Overall, this is a good coffeemaker, but the carafe ... not so much.",David S.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de julio de 2023
"Great coffee maker, some minor design flaws","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this coffee maker. The brew time seems a little long, but not extraordinary. The metal carafe keeps the coffee super hot for hours. This was the main reason I wanted it. I was tired of burnt coffee from leaving the glass carafe on the heater. An added bonus is the built in replaceable water filter. I would have given 5 stars if not for the opening on the top of the carafe. As other reviews have stated, the hole on top of the carafe is too small to get your hand in to clean the inside. It requires some kind of handled brush. Second, you can't pour all the coffee out without turning it completely upside down and shaking it. Again, not a huge deal if you don't need to drink every last drop. The ""waste"" is minimal, maybe 1/3 of a cup. However, it does cause an issue if you want to use the carafe to fill the reservoir which everyone does. You would have to hold it over the sink and shake it upside down to get the rest of the water out so you don't brew your coffee into the leftover water. I have adapted by using the spray hose on the sink to fill it. Not a great design as far as pouring and cleaning. But it looks great, it is built solidly and it makes a terrific pot of coffee. Oh it also came with a reusable metal mesh cone filter, another bonus.",derek macdougall,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de marzo de 2022
Well done and good looking,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is my first go-around with a thermal rather than a glass carafe. (I got tired of constantly and accidentally cracking the glass! Hopefully, this does better.) It's not like for the small quantities I make the thermal carafe will be sitting there for half an hour anyway, so I don't need a hot plate.

I played it by the book first time around, using the 1-4 setting and bold, which would describe my preferences and the volume at issue. As some have noted, it didn't come out really, really hot, but that was the 1-4 setting. Even on my old non-thermal coffee maker, using the 1-4 setting really slowed down brewing and reduced its ability to come out as hot as I'd like. I abandoned the 1-4 setting even for about 3.5 cups worth and everything was great in flavor, speed and heat. We'll see how durable this is, but for now, very satisfied for quality.

Quibbles? It does seem kind of hard to pour the entire volume of brewed coffee from the pot. It just doesn't seem to want to pour as it gets down to the last ounce or two. I find myself twisting off the top to get more access to the coffee. Not a big deal, and I'd have to twist it off anyway to clean it.",monesqe,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de agosto de 2022
Excellent & hot coffee but stupid ergonomics.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a successor to a prior model that we had on which the hinges on the top cover broke. Using it is an annoyance, though. Directions say to first insert the filter basket and filter and then to put in coffee grounds. However, if you grind your own coffee, you'll get ground coffee all over this way. Further, when you then add water, the opening is so small that you'll wind up accidentally wetting the grounds in advance, which is particularly bad if setting it at night on the timer to start brewing several hours later in the morning. The solution is to leave the filter basket out and pour in the water first, which will spill slightly because of the small opening, but no harm will be done. However, the basket will not stand on its own so you need to find some kind of receptacle into which you can put the basket so you can put in the filter and then the ground coffee. Anything more or less cylindrical with sufficient diameter and depth will do. Then put the basket with the coffee grounds into place in the top of the maker. The directions do not so state but the filter must be precisely aligned so that it can be manually pushed down about 1/4"" or the top will not close. I suspect some disaster may occur like overflow at the top if the cover is not fully closed. These are ergonomic issues that need not be and I find annoying. On the positive side, the coffee is excellent and hot, which means it is brewing at the proper temperature for optimal extraction. It has a bold brew option that I like as I like strong coffee. I believe this causes the brewing cycle to be a little longer so the water sits on the coffee longer. Brewing time is still only a bit over one minute per cup. It has a chime that rings when brewing is complete, which mercifully may be set to off with an on/off button. The carafe is stainless steel and does keep coffee hot for 4 -5 hours. Unfortunately, another design issue leads to the carafe spilling when pouring out the last of its contents. My priorities were to get good, hot coffee brewed at proper temperature and a stainless carafe at a reasonable price. I found no competing products that met my priorities. I accept these rather stupid design issues, but I hope Cuisinart will address them before I next need a replacement.",Martin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de abril de 2019
Heavy and drippy,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","We have always had Cuisinart coffeemakers. Love them. Good quality, long lasting, easy to use, etc etc. So when my husband wanted to get a coffeemaker with a thermal carafe, he bought a Cuisinart. And because of “brand trust”, he didn’t check reviews. (Always check reviews.) Well, after struggling with this one for a few weeks, I finally put my cup down and insisted we get rid of it.

The issues are pretty much as everyone else reports. First off, the carafe is uncomfortably heavy. Personally, I don’t have the forearms for it. YMMV. Next, it drips and splatters when you pour. And not a little. And it doesn’t matter how careful you try to be — use two hands, go slow — you WILL be wiping up your counter afterward. Every single time. And finally, if you want that last cup of coffee, you need to turn the pot almost completely upside down to get it.

All of these flaws are just symptoms of the incredibly thick thermal wall. Which might keep your coffee hot for the whole day, but in the end, is that really necessary for many people? Oh, and for those few out there who actually wash your carafes instead of just swishing some water in it and calling it done? Well, those thick walls also mean you can’t get your hand in there. So it’s either the dishwasher or the “swishwasher” with this carafe.

On the “pro” side? The reservoir has a measure stick, so it’s easy to fill — IF you have a pull out faucet. The coffeemaker makes decent coffee. And of course, the carafe keeps the coffee hot.",Naomi Bell,Revisado en Canadá el 23 de agosto de 2023
NEW FAVORITE for 2 coffee lovers!!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This Cuisinart coffee maker is our new favorite for several reasons! In our house, coffee is like oxygen. We need it to exist. We've been through many coffee makers over the years, and this one is definitely a keeper! Why? I'll tell you:

1) We drink our coffee black and as strong as possible, so taste is extremely important. NO covering up weak or bad tasting coffee with creamer or sweetener. This coffee maker delivers a cup of great tasting coffee, and the machine has the option for regular or BOLD - so obviously we choose bold.

2) We like to drink our coffee throughout the morning, and want it to be HOT without having to reheat it. The stainless steel carafe keeps the coffee at the perfect temperature for several hours. We have it programmed to brew at 5am, and it's still nice and piping at 11am. Since the coffee maker does not remain on for hours after brewing, there is no risk of burnt tasting coffee, or getting that burn ring underneath the carafe like we have with glass carafes in the past.

3) We prepare the coffee at night before bed, and don't want to spend forever getting it set up, OR cleaning it! I have read reviews stating that it is hard to clean the carafe, and it is hard to fill the water reserve with the carafe. I use a bottle brush with a long handle (same as I use for my tall stainless steel water bottles) and have no problem cleaning the inside of the carafe. With regard to filling up the water reserve, keep the lid on the carafe when pouring to avoid spilling, and then pour from the other direction to fill up that last bit - OR - use something other than the carafe to fill it up!

Great tasting coffee, easy to use, easy to clean - win win win!",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de agosto de 2022
Horrible design!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I can't believe this coffeemaker is as highly reviewed as it is. First of all, the stainless steel carafe is impossible to pour because of the border at the top that goes in about an inch all the way around. When full, you have to tilt it 90 degrees just to get a slow trickle. When it's almost empty it is literally impossible to get the rest out without coffee spilling out the sides of the lid, so if you want to avoid spilling and wiping up every time the only option is to pour every cup over the sink, unless you're fine wasting half a cup of coffee every day, and even then you'll still need to pour it out before you brew the next pot. I know the reason for this is to keep the coffee hot, and this isn't unique to Cuisinart. All stainless steel carafes seem to have this design. I just don't know why most people seem to think this is ok.

Another issue is the steam. Of course all coffeemakers need a way to allow steam to escape, but the steam is particularly strong with this one. The 3 holes at the rear top allow a strong layer of steam to hit the bottom of your kitchen cabinet doors even if you have the coffeemaker pulled out to the edge of the counter, and it's not a light steam. Even after just one use there was a clear film that you can't remove with a wet cloth. It's only visible in certain light and at this point is something I can deal with, but I certainly don't want to keep exposing my cabinets to this steam. Cheaper coffeemakers I've had have the steam holes on the side, or they just aren't as powerful and so the steam is not as thick. Unlike the pouring issue, this issue can at least be solved by having the coffeemaker somewhere outside the range of cabinets, such as on a cart, so that the steam has more room to dissipate.

The third issue is that it is pretty much impossible for condensation not to drip out of the holes in the back and down the coffeemaker when you open the lid after brewing a pot. Not a huge issue but again, for a supposedly quality coffeemaker, having to wipe up water dripping out the back after every single use is not something you should have to do. I bought this coffeemaker thinking it would be an improvement and make my coffeemaking routine easier, not more difficult, than the cheap one I've been using for the past 10-15 years.

Of course I didn't start using this coffeemaker until about a month after I purchased it, so by the time I realized all its flaws the return policy had passed, so now I'm out 90 dollars and have a completely useless hunk of stainless steel and plastic. It certainly looks cool, and the functionality is exactly what I was looking for. It just amazes me that supposedly reputable companies like Cuisinart can build products like this with such clear shortcomings. Did they not test it out themselves? Did they really think it's ok to have a carafe that only pours a slow trickle when full, and CAN'T pour out all the coffee without having to turn it completely upside down and spilling? And how is it that people are ok with this? Oh well I guess my standards are just unreasonably high. I'm just so sad that this is where we're at as a civilization. Every time I look at the coffeemaker I'm reminded of all the time spent researching to find the right one, the excitement of finally opening the box, and then the slow realization that I'd have to do it all over again after discovering one ridiculous design oversight after another. It's still sitting on my counter because I haven't had the time or energy to look for another one, but when I do, I'm pretty sure one of the cheaper models with the glass carafe will be the way to go.",mike,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de diciembre de 2019
Design flaw causes water to trickle all down the back everytime the lid is opened..,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Place it on a mat to protect your surface and keep an eye on the area around the cord! Luckily we keep our coffee maker on a silicon mat designed to prevent spills from getting to the surface of the furniture.
It is also in an open area, at the end of our counter. Luckily I noticed the water gathering under the back, around electrical cord before it became a problem. When making coffee, steam and condensation gather on the inside of the lid. After the coffee is done, when you lift the lid, water trickles down the back of the coffee maker. Now, there is a little 'lip' on the back that I presume is supposed to catch and prevent the water from making its way to your counter-top. ahhh no... it just waits until you least expect it then drools its way on down . Basically that little lip just redirects the water along until it dribbles off the lip and down the unit, gathering around the bottom. I used the coffee maker several times before I noticed there was a puddle of water all under the unit, around and under the cord. The first picture is after one use -my opening the lid to remove the old grounds. This is a rather serious design flaw.

UPDATE: Down-grading my review to one star! Bought on May 6, 2023 and the water gathering at the back is just ridiculous. The added pictures show how much water gathers when as you open the lid (to prepare the next pot). I'm not talking immediately after the last pot either... I make ONE pot each morning. Next morning, after I get rid of the old grounds and grind fresh beans, I have to pick this *&$&#^ thing up and remove all the water from under it.

Update 2: We made it two months before finally deciding it just wasn't worth the headache. I have gone with buying a replacement (Mr coffee carafe with the removable water container). That's what we had before and it is just so much better than this thing..",Mythral,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de mayo de 2023
"Update!!!! Worth every penny! Don't think, just buy!","1,0 de 5 estrellas","Unfortunately, after less than a year I'm updating my review. The coffee pot quit brewing a whole pot, first leaving only a cup of water in the reservoir. I thought maybe it was just Calcium build up so I started empyring it daily and leaving it open to dry. I clean the carafe weekly and run scale remover through monthly. This morning it took a nose dive and will only brew one cup at a time before its alarming that it's done. There's still almost a whole ressevior full of water! This thing didn't even outlast any of my Walmart coffee makers. Disappointing.

I have been looking and researching thermal carafe coffee makers for years. I constantly break glass carafes and sometimes have trouble finding new ones that would fit. I've been replacing coffee pots every year or less because of thr broken carafes, the leal, or stop working. I was hesitant to purchase a thermal because I worried the coffee would not be hot when my husband woke up two hours later. I tested this on the first run when the recommend you run a cycle of plain water. At two hours, the coffee was piping hot! At three hours, the coffee was still piping hot! You can see the steam rising from the carafe after I removed the lid. This unit does have a hot plate that I assume helps to warm the coffee during brewing. It is hot immediately after but cools down quickly after brewing is complete. The coffee tastes great! Way better than the Walmart coffee pots I've been buying. It's definitely a high end coffee pot and the taste and quality shows. Like previous users mention, it is a heavy carafe when full and you do have to tip it almost completely upside down to get that last cup out. In my opinion those are minor inconveniences. I've dealt with more annoying issues that actually affect the functionality from cheaper pots. If this thing continues to functionality as well as it is, I forsee it will outlast any of my other pots!",Jessi,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de diciembre de 2022
If it weren't for the carafe this would actually be a good or better coffee maker,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","If it weren't for the carafe this would actually be a good or better coffee maker. The top inside of the carafe is flat not sloped like most glass carafes. When everyone says you have to turn it completely upside down to get the coffee out - you do. When they say it dribbles all over the place while getting all the coffee out - it does. When they say you can't use the carafe to fill it with water - you'll give up after the first attempt. The safest way to drain the carafe is to turn it upside down over a small pot then pour your coffee into your intended target. I carry a 48oz thermos and filling it with the carafe is impossible. You want to clean it - better have a bottle brush - I doubt a six year old could their hand in this thing.
My 94 year old mother can no longer get her own coffee because of this poor design.
It is by far the slowest brewer I have ever owned.
You can't tell if it's done - no light. At least you can see into a glass carafe.
It does make a decent cup of coffee if you don't mind waiting 15-20 minutes.
It keeps the coffee hot for a reasonable time but it's not like having a glass carafe on a burner.

I had a Gevalia coffee coffee maker with a thermal carafe that was awesome but it died after about 15 years. I should have listened to the 1 star reviews - I didn't but now can't stand to throw a 140.00 coffee maker in the trash. I'd give it away but that would be rude to whoever got it.

It sure looks like the designers never tried to use their creation - it never would have made it to market.

But I digress - Cuisinart lost it on this one - I guess everyone can make a lemon - oh yeah - did they ever.

UPDATE - 01/24/21
While the carafe still bites and there is no fixing it, I like the DCC3400 so much that I did a little research and found -thanks to many DCC3200 owners - that the glass carafe from the 3200 fits the 3400 like a glove and doesn't spit, spew, dribble, leak... everywhere while trying to add water to the tank or pour hot coffee into a thermos. With that said there is no warming plate on the 3400 so the coffee gets cold fast, unless you put it in a thermos or on a warm stove.",Bruce,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de enero de 2021
Don't Waste Your Money,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I only had this coffeemaker for four months before it stopped working. For the price I paid--I would have expected a much better product. The cord started having a short in it after just a few months of using it (of course past the date of returning it). I would have to jiggle the cord to make it work. Now it doesn't even work when jiggling the cord; it would turn back on but when I tried to brew the coffee it immediately shut off even though the machine showed it was on before selecting the brew button.

Also, one of the reasons I purchased it was because some reviewers said the coffee was hotter than other coffeemakers. Not true. After pouring the coffee in my coffee cup, I would then have to put it in the microwave for 30 seconds to make it truly hot.

In addition, it is difficult to pour the water in the machine when you are making the coffee. It only has a small area in which to add your water; otherwise, it will spill into the surrounding areas and down the outside of it. The coffee pot itself is also much heavier than the glass pitchers--making it more difficult to pour it into a cup.

I would NOT recommend spending your money on this item. I rarely write negative reviews on products, but I wanted to warn others about this item as it is quite expensive and definitely not worth the price or aggravation.",Kathleen S.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de octubre de 2023
"Doesn't brew through filter, big mess!","1,0 de 5 estrellas","I have been looking for a coffee maker for 6 mos, no lie. I know, I research things to death! Was originally looking for coffee maker w/built in grinder but seems as though those are incredibly loud according to reviews, so decided to get a good grinder separately and this Cuisinart coffee maker. Issues from day 1. When I brew on the 1-4 cup cycle it seems fine, doesn't brew 4 cups like my old coffee maker though, so we decided to go to 5 and even 6 and use regular brew cycle. Every time I use the regular brew cycle it brews about 1/2 of a cup, overflows from basket and I'm cleaning up a huge mess and reaching for my Keurig or old auto drip Ninja. Only had it a week so back it goes but what a hassle! Has definitely given me a not so warm and fuzzy feeling on Cuisinart products. Off to clean up and dump the basket full of water so I can pack up and send back.
PS, pouring is awful with this pot but honestly if it had brewed correctly I'd have overlooked it, but you have to practically turn it upside down to pour. I imagine if I was able to brew a full pot it would be easier to pour the first 4 or so cups but after they get your wrist ready and a rag for cleaning ion the side. 1star for aesthetics, it does look nice but that's it.",Carolyn,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de julio de 2023
DON'T BUY. Drips onto counter every time you pour,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I've had this machine for nine months. Bought it to replace a similar Cuisinart coffeemaker that I had had for more than a decade. I was reluctant to buy this machine because our general experience is that Cuisinart makes sub-par quality products. We have an electric kettle and electric griddle and both started to have malfunctioning features within a short amount of time. But I put a lot of hours into researching coffeemakers and kept coming back to this as the best option for the quality of coffee and features I wanted (e.g., pause and serve).

I HATE this machine.

When I first bought it it make very loud popping/puffing sounds when brewing. Alarmingly so. That has gotten better over time but I should have followed my intuition and returned it then.

The biggest problem with this machine is that that pot drips all over when you pour a cup of coffee. I had seen some reviews that mentioned that and thought ""User error. People must be pouring at an awkward angle."" And the carafe seemed similar to the one I had previously. It is not user error. It is really bad design. There are two problems:
(1) the top of the pot lid collects coffee as it brews. So, if you grab the pot and immediately pour, any little bit of coffee on the top will pour over the edge onto your counter or feet;
(2) the inside lip of the pot causes coffee to come out at a slightly off angle, again leaving your counter or floor with drips.

There basically isn't a way to pour this without coffee dripping on to something. And you might think - no big deal, I'll just wipe it up. But it drips where you don't expect it to, stains the side of the pot and just makes a mess. I even experimented with leaving a kitchen cloth on the counter so that it would catch drips. That works, but ruins the towel in the process. With 4-5 drips on every pour, it doesn't take long to stain the whole thing brown.

I believe firmly in buying quality products and using them until they no longer work. But I'm back here to shop for a replacement because this is too aggravating.",Perpetual Student,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de julio de 2021
Constantly dripping carafe,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",We have had this coffee maker for 9 months now and we are so fed up with it. It is impossible to pour yourself a cup of coffee without it constantly dripping and spilling over everything. Extremely disappointed.

Poorly enginesed,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Update 6/16/2018: Our opinion of this product has only gotten worse over time. I've learned how to pour water into it so that most of the time it all goes into the reservoir, but I have to mop up some almost half of the time. I've learned that I don't like coffee made with reusable metal filters due to the fine sediment that always gets through and, as detailed below, this maker does not work with paper filters. The metal filter clogs frequently so that I am either greeted by grounds in my coffee or on the counter or both. I give up. I'm throwing it into the trash. Be warned.

Original review: This is a poorly designed product. For the price, I expected it to be more thoughtfully engineered. It's extremely difficult to use the thermal carafe to refill the reservoir without spilling water onto the counter. I've been making coffee most of my adult life, over 50 years, and this is the worst. The carafe also does not allow all coffee to be easily poured. Removing the cap helps, but to get the last bit out, you also have to turn it completely upside down, which means it doesn't flow over the spout, but splatters around the lip of the cup.

The rate at which the hot water flows onto the coffee grounds is too fast to use a paper filter, so you have to use the (included) metal cone, which is fine if you don't mind fine grounds in your coffee. I prefer the extra filtration provided by paper filters, but after experimenting with various degrees of grind, I've given up on paper and am living with the results one gets with the metal filter.

The coffee is HOT. I don't use a creamer, so I pour my coffee about a half hour before I'll be ready to drink it. This, admittedly, is a minor quibble, but it just adds to my dissatisfaction with this product.

The only good thing about it is that the combination of really hot coffee and a well sealed carafe means that it keeps the coffee warm for hours.

I informed Cuisinart of my unhappiness with the engineering of this coffee maker. Hopefully the next one will be better.",Joel B,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de noviembre de 2017
Will Not Honor Warranty,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this coffee maker 11/25/20. It has a three year warranty. This is my sixth Cuisinart coffee maker. When first received, it made excellent hot coffee. However, after two years and four months, the coffee was not making hot coffee. This has occurred with almost every Cuisinart coffee maker I have had. In the past, Cuisinart has always honored their warrant. They sent a replacement and required a photo of the cut cord, which I gladly did after receiving the replacement Now, after only 15 months, it once again was not making hot coffee. I called Cuisinart and spoke to a representative who informed me I had to cut the cord and send the photo BEFORE they would send me a replacement, which would leave me without a coffee maker for two weeks. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, he became rude and refused and placed me on hold for 30 minutes. I called back, spoke to another representative, requested a supervisor and was placed on hold for more than twenty minutes. I called again and was finally put through to a supervisor. He also refused to send a replacement without first having a photo of the cut cord. When I asked if they would rather loose a good customer they replied that would not deviate from their NEW policy.

DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","On February 15, 2021, I purchased The Cuisinart Stainless Steel Thermal Coffeemaker, 12 Cup Carafe, Silver, and paid a Total of $115.65 for it, Way more than I should have, but I wanted a thermal coffee carafe, and I thought Cuisinart was a quality brand name. Ha! The coffee maker worked great until the Return Date passed (March 18, 2021). In mid to late April, I noticed that the pouring spout started to ""dribble"" and pouring coffee into my coffee mug was messy. In order to keep the coffee from dribbling on the counter, I had to hold the mug over the sink as I poured the coffee into it to prevent splattering on the counter. I was unhappy, as I thought Cuisinart should have been a better quality item for what I paid for it. But knowing the return date was passed and I couldn't return it, I figured I would just have to learn to live with the ""messy pour"". Then on August 3, 2021, (Less than six months after I purchased it) the Auto Set Function Stopped Working. Why? I don't know! One day it worked, and the next day it didn't. I set it to brew my coffee for 4:00 am, as usual, and when I went to pour my coffee at 4:15 am, there was NO coffee in the pot to pour. After I pushed the Brew Button, several times, it finally started working. After the pot of coffee was finally filled, I poured the coffee into another insulated carafe that I have, and thoroughly cleaned the coffee maker. It STILL will not work on the AUTO function, which thoroughly annoys and disappoints me. I sincerely doubt either Amazon or Cuisinart will do anything about this, but if this Cuisinart Coffee Maker is typical of Cuisinart ""Quality"", than I just want to save someone else the aggravation of paying a lot of money for poor Quality.",phoenix,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de agosto de 2021
Poorly designed and poorly made,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This is my very last Cuisinart product, ever.

There are numerous flaws with this machine.

First, the carafe is very poorly made. The plastic lid warps with use and doesn't fit properly. This makes pours go all over the place. It is also difficult to clean as the ""trap"" used to keep it from leaking during pours also traps soapy water in the lid when cleaning.

The plastic attached to the top of the stainless steel is badly sealed and the seal seems to fail over time. This causes pours to go all over the place and dirty water gets trapped inside of the plastic and, probably, mixes with coffee when brewing or pouring.

Cuisinart was nice enough to replace the carafe for free after the first one failed, but the second one quickly became just as bad.

On top of that the two tiny ports for adding water are poorly placed right next to the hinged lid and it's almost impossible to fill without spilling water.

Because of this, the carafe leaks and probably for other reasons, the plate under the carafe rusts over time to the point where it's a total mess.

Leaks from pouring and elsewhere also cause the bottom of the machine to get wet and rust, staining countertops and worse. I ended up putting extra tall rubber feet on the unit which helped only a little.

Regardless, I'm now shopping for a new system from anyone but Cuisinart.",kar,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de mayo de 2023
Get the glass Carafe version instead,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","We had a Cuisinart Coffee maker that lasted 10 year it was an earlier version with nobs and a glass carafe. It finally died and my wife decided we should try the steel carafe version because it should keep coffee tasting better. Well I won't speak to coffee taste, but in every other aspect the steel carafe, while well made, is a design disaster. A list of it's many shortcomings:
1. You can't see how much water you're filling it with so it's not helpful as a measuring device. The glass version we could use as our measuring cup to fill with water before pouring into the machine. Now we have to use a separate container.
2. The ergonomics to pour out of the steel carafe are very awkward. Compared to the glass carafe you have to practically turn you wrist upside down when you pour. It's a very awkward motion and makes for greater difficulty in making a clean pour.
3. You have no idea how much coffee is left. (See point one.) This should have been obvious given it's steel, but you don't think about how helpful that is if you're making coffee for more than one person and they don't all get it at the same time.
4. The steel carafe cools the coffee. Unless you pre-warm the carafe with hot water, the steel carafe will suck out all the heat from the coffee and leave you with tepid coffee. With no active heating element, you're quickly left with cool coffee which defeats the purpose of a carafe in the first place.

All in All a well built machine with a lousy carafe design. You're much better off getting the glass carafe version and saving the money; it's a far more functional machine. If you're the kind of person who's obsessed about fresh tasting coffee, get a separate thermos to hold your coffee hot and not overheated. This insulated carafe is a poor choice.",MN Home Cook,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de enero de 2019
THREE STRIKES AND CUISINART IS OUT,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought the first of three Cuisinart Coffee Makers for our FL home, based on the name recognition, outstanding ratings, and preferring a thermal carafe rather than easily breakable glass. When we came back to FL after the summer up North, I was shocked to find the metal disc on the underside of the coffeemaker had permanently stained the white granite counter with rust colored streaks that could not be scrubbed off and would need granite restoration. I assumed this was a defective unit to be leaking water from the underside and exchanged it for the same model. I was smart enough to put a rubber heat pad under the unit just in case, as the rust reappeared but did not damage the counter. The ease of use and flavor of the coffee was good, and important to us, the coffee stayed hot for several hours. For those reasons, I ordered the same model for our home up North. I protected the counter, but less than 11 months later, the entire unit malfunctioned and this morning I found the coffee that was set to brew ran out through the slits in the metal disc (that was again disgustingly rusted) and I woke up to 12 cups of coffee all over my white Corian counter and dripping down each drawer and onto the floor.

don't buy this.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Upside: It makes an overall nice flavor (if you use the bold button), and customer service really did try to correct the problems by sending a new basket, a new lid, and a new carafe. Originally gave a 3-star review for this reason...
I had to come back to downgrade
Downside: 4 months of trying to make this work and have finally thrown in the towel. can't make more than 8 cups to stop the grinds from going EVERYWHERE. the carafe is very awkward to pour-it spills over at the full mark and impossible to empty at the end unless you take off the lid... The coffee also dribbles all over from the side of the spout and the top part of the lid, so it's a bit of a mess no matter when you pour. The carafe is also too hot to place on a surface if you're serving a crowd at a table. And in case you're groggily filling the water reservoir, there is hole in the back so you don't overfill it that just drains right out onto the counter--great so you don't get a steaming hot overflow of coffee and burn yourself, but still makes a mess...

Do not buy. Bad design in many ways,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","The listing says ""Adjustable ... auto-off timer (0-4 hours)"". This model does not have adjustable auto-off. The hot plate shuts off as soon as the brew cycle is complete. They assume you will always use this unit with the supplied thermal carafe. And likewise, there is no control over the hot plate temperature. That is probably fine when using the thermal carafe. However, it is possible to use this coffee maker with the Cuisinart 14-cup glass carafe. Just be aware the hot plate won't continue to heat that carafe.
=====
After a month of use, I can't recommend this product at all. It is poorly designed. I previously owned the equivalent model with a glass carafe and it was fine. But this one is a mess. You can't do anything without making a mess. Coffee collects in the carafe cover and spills off the first time you try to pout. If you try the ""steal a cup"" while brewing, coffee gets all over the hot plate. And if you lift the top cover while it is brewing, water spills out the back of the unit.

faulty product + company's solution is ridiculous = do not recommend,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","My coffee maker's time function stopped working after a couple weeks for no reason, therefore the programmable option was not an option. I need the option to program for early mornings. I'm outside the return window, but Cuisinart says it's a warranty issue (great!). Only problem is they require you cut the cord and send them pictures of it no longer working BEFORE they will send you a new one. They say it will take AT LEAST ten days before they send it. So basically they want me to wait at least 10 days without a coffee maker because their product stopped working less than 2 months after purchase!?!? It's nice they want to fix their faulty product but I cannot get behind them making me wait without coffee in my house for several weeks. That's just bad customer service. I'll be buying a different brand.

Oh - and if you still want to get one, the thermos is nice and keeps the coffee warm, but it typically drips/spills when you pour the cups. It's also annoying that you cannot detach the water reservoir to fill it up - instead you pour cup after cup to fill it up.

The Absolute Worst Carafe I Have Ever Used,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I never write reviews but this one just needs to be said, repeatedly. This product is AWFUL. It makes great coffee, it is a sleek machine, but the carafe is unbelievable. There is zero chance that any human being on the planet ever performed any quality control on it, because the issues are immediate, glaring, and infuriating.

When you pour, it sprays everywhere. Like, so badly that it even somehow sprays BEHIND the carafe as you pour. Amazing.

Next up, to get the last cup or so of liquid out of the carafe, you will need to physically remove the cap, turn it completely upside down, and shake it vigorously. There is absolutely no way to pour it out of the spout.

For a pricey, 'high-end' coffee machine, I am blown away with how awful it is. Carafes have been a solved problem for decades now. Even the cheapest $5 Mr. Coffee carafe is vastly superior to this overpriced paper weight. I am absolutely blown away by this, and will probably never buy anything Cuisinart related again because of it, it's just that bad.

Brews 12 cups—6 to drink and 6 for the countertop and floors.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","We put it into the trash after the second morning because it brewed coffee all over the countertop—twice! The first morning it worked fine, but the coffee was weak. Figured it was because we were not used to the measurements. This morning, the second morning, my husband exclaimed he was throwing it away because the coffee overflowed and there were chunks of coffee grounds in and on the pot. “Honey,” I said, “you just need to follow the measurements—don’t overfill and make sure everything is seated properly as designed.” I read the instructions, carefully measured the water and the grounds, ensured the cone with a paper filter was seated firmly, and placed the pot firmly and jiggled it to make sure. Hit the Bold button and Brew/Off and waited in the living room to prove my husband was overreacting. I didn’t hear anything for at least 10 minutes. I went into the kitchen to look and there was coffee all over the counter and puddled on the floor! As soon as I walked in the machine beeped that it was done brewing. My husband unplugged the machine and put it straight into the garbage can. Meanwhile, I spent 30 minutes cleaning up the mess and coffee-stained counters and floors. Bye bye $100 because we stupidly got rid of the packaging and cannot return it or get a refund from Amazon. Thanks to Cuisinart, we now know what not to buy in a coffee maker design.

Water and grounds every where,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Really wanted to like this coffee maker but morning coffee should not be this annoying.

From reading reviews I knew you could not use the actual pot to fill the water reservoir so I used a pitcher and it worked as long as the angle was right to hit the little fill zone area. If you bump the open top or move a little the water pours through the brewing area and onto the counter.

If I filled it all the way up to the 12 cup line there was more coffee than fit in the pot and coffee ran onto the counter. Speaking of the carafe, the design makes it impossible to empty without removing the lid and turning the carafe upside down as the spout is so far into the middle of the pot that coffee can not clear the ridge the top screws into just by regular pouring.

And the most annoying aspect, grounds everywhere. The kept overflowing the filter and got in the coffee, around the edge, down the funnel area for the filter, everywhere! I tried different grinds, different size filters, various filters but nothing helped the problem.

I really wanted to like and tried to make this coffee maker work but all this annoyance for coffee is not needed. The temperature was good and it did make decent coffee right up to the mouthful of grounds.",Linda Moquin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de noviembre de 2021
Preferred prior Cuisinart Coffee Maker,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","While I like that this Cuisinart is not as tall as a prior model, there are features that I find less ergonomic or functional. I am not a fan of how this pours. Once you get toward the end of the pot, it is difficult to fully empty it -- whether into the coffee maker or into a coffee cup. I have a smaller hand and find that the handle is bulky/thick and not that comfortable. I also think the low profile of the lid makes it more challenging to screw it on and off. Overall, not my favorite model from a UX perspective. To end on a happy note, we do have coffee brewed before we wake up and it stays hot.

The carafe and water reservoir inlet make this a hard pass.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Many (including us) would be better off with a $15 coffee maker... It's astonishing to see how many 5 star reviews this received.

Cons:

1. Carafe cannot be emptied, even if tipped entirely upside down.
2. Carafe pours about as fast as a child's sippy cup. It's comically slow.
3. Carafe cannot be used to actually fill the coffee maker due to the extremely small inlet design coupled with the reservoir's lid not actually opening beyond 90 degrees. Plan to dedicate a pitcher just for the purpose of adding water.
4. The fitment of the grounds basket and carafe (when seated) is such that if it is off by the slightest amount you will have coffee flowing over the top of the lid onto the hot plate and eventually your counter.

....if you want coffee grinds with your cup of coffee!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","We are particular about our coffee and insist on a thermal carafe to keep our coffee hot without becoming bitter. We also wanted a 12-cup capacity so there would be adequate coffee remaining for our ""travelers"" in route to work. First off we were disappointed that this model apparently has no ability to regulate the temperature of the coffee, thus we found ourselves reheating the coffee in the microwave. We also felt that the carafe was bulky and difficult to handle. This often resulted with coffee that did not make its way directly into the cup; rather coffee ended up on the countertop..

We bought a coffee maker with a 12 cup capacity because we wanted 12 cups.

Horrible design. Just horrible.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","So much wrong. Thermal carafe won't pour easily because the lip around the pour spout is too wide, needing to hold carafe completely horizontal to begin pouring (which tends to drip coffee all over), and needing to hold carafe completely upside down to finish emptying (almost -- can't quite get it empty). Water reservoir has small opening near the back of the coffee maker making it difficult to fill -- near impossible with the thermal carafe -- and the water amount indicator is on the side, somewhat out of sight, which you must use because the carafe doesn't have cup markings. Also, my coffee maker sometimes gave me lukewarm coffee and the clock never kept correct time, making it necessary to reset each day and the auto-on feature not working because of it.

A Big Disappointment in an Attractice Package!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I never write reviews but we are so disappointed with this coffemaker that I feel I have no choice! This is our second Cuidinart coffeemaker and this one is decidedly inferior to the first and it was more expensive. We find it awkward to fill the reservoir and watch the cup indicator on the side at the same time. The coffee is not consistent in keeping the coffee hot, even if the pot is first warmed with boiling water. Sometimes it is hot enough and sometimes it isn’t. The coffee pours very poorly and it drains slowly out of the pot rather than poring crisply into the cup, dribbling and splattering the coffee all over the counter and down the sides of our mugs. And if the top of the pot is in place, it drains out of the holes in the top rather than from the spout after pouring the first two cups! Because of the thick rim on the inside of the top of the pot, even with the top off, the pot has to be turned completely upside down to pour a cup from the still partially filled (not almost empty) pot. This rim makes it hard to clean, too. We’ll not get another like this. Overall, it is inconvenient to fill and use, and it produces a tepid (literally) cup of coffee. To end on a good note, it looks nice, was packaged securely and it arrived on time. None of these things make for a good cup of coffee.",Susan T.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de enero de 2021
Poor design,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","We've had this coffee maker for 3 1/2 months. It has several design flaws. It drip-brewed the coffee just fine in the beginning but started showing signs of problems after only a month of daily use. #1Cleaning/descaling it (we do have hard water) with a vinegar solution caused all of the paint on the plate where the carafe rests to chip off and it quickly rusted. #2 The metal plate goes through to the bottom of the coffee maker; it rusted within a month due to moisture on the counter. #3 The thermal carafe does keep the coffee warm, but it is near impossible to pour when you get to the bottom few cups without removing the lid. #4 Lastly, the pump that moves the hot water stopped pumping out all of the water after 3 months of use. For example, if you put in 12 cups of water, it would only pump out 9 cups and you would have to push the brew button again and again to complete the 12 cups. Our previous Krupa coffee maker lasted 18 years. This is going in the trash and we will go back to Krups.",lak41,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de junio de 2022
Campfire Coffee Lovers,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","If--like me--you relish memories of ""campfire coffee"" (handful of coffee grounds tossed into boiling water), poured from a rusty pork & beans tin can held at distance between two sticks, and pack a microwave and generator in your donkey's saddlebags to heat up freshly-brewed coffee, you're gonna love this coffee maker! For all the fruitbats out there who are asking ""What about those of us who sleep hanging upside down?"" You've hit the jackpot as the thermos carafe was designed by one of your very own and requires the human person to stand on its head or hang from the ceiling to pour. I'm pretty much a caveat emptor sort of guy myself, but my better half insists that we warn others. Oh, BTW she says to tell the R&D folks to hire product designers who (a) are coffee drinkers, (2) understand fluid dynamics, and (thirdly) get the basic 2mya concept of ""fire"" for making stuff hot.

Carafe drips and the fill guide wears off,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Went thru two of these with the same issues. Returned the first under warranty. Issue number 1, the carafe drips all over when you pour. Issue number 2, and I think this issue applies to a lot of of their coffee makers, the guide for filling the coffee maker wears off if you wipe the side off the maker. First one that did this, they sent me a replacement, but only after I sent them a photo off the power cord cut off at the base. I then had to wait almost a month for the replacement to arrive. The replacement fill guide rubbed off when faster than the original. Warning, they call this a cosmetic issue not an operational issue. Of course if the fill guide rubs off, how do you know how much water to put in the maker.

Can't pour without spilling!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","The thermal carafe lid / spout design is terrible. It's impossible to pour (the first cup or three) after a full pot brew, without coffee spilling out / down the pot and leaking on the counter. Even when trying careful / slow pours it still happens. Also not a fan of the water tank, the entire top of the coffee pot flips up (where you access the tank to add water). If you have your coffee pot under cabinets (like we do), you have to pull the pot out from under cabinets in order to fill the water tank. Also, the clock was broken out of the box for us (the time shows and the display works, but it's very fast. After setting clock (sometime in the morning), it was about 30min fast by the evening.

Winner World's Worst Carafe,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Whoever designed this monster must have worked hard to engineer the carafe so that, when you pour from it, coffee gets everywhere. Although hard to clean, the carafe also has a stubborn lid that needs to be twisted in specialized ways into place, otherwise the coffee will pour everywhere while brewing, so even before it's finished! Good news is, there are many other ways the lukewarm coffee will spill everywhere, including thanks to the filter, which if not put in just right (using force), will cause the machine to swamp. But fear not, although tank-like, the carafe doesn't keep the coffee hot, even though (strangely given that it looks like a wartime thermos) it's heated from below, giving the coffee (cooled by the useless stainless steal juggernaut of a carafe) that musty flavor of less expensive drip machine (with a carafe that actually pours) . The design of this machine is, admittedly, unattractive, yet the thin veneer of stainless steel almost always gets spotted with fingerprints, so that you notice it in your kitchen. But try pouring water from that weaponized carafe into the reservoir, and unless you are a professional magician, it's impossible not to spill it all over yourself and the kitchen. But the champion remains that carafe! The Pinto of coffee machines, except compared to this beast, the Pinto was a thing of beauty. All five star reviews must have been written by Cuisinart employees.",Murrayhill,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de febrero de 2021
Bye Bye Baby.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought this unit from Amazon in August 2017 and it's going in the trash this week. Makes good coffee and keeps it hot, but those qualities are overshadowed by design flaws and performance issues. The thermal carafe itself has a serious design flaw that makes it impossible to pour water or coffee out of it without at least seriously dripping, and most often splattering liquid outside of the target container. We have resorted to holding our cups over the sink while pouring coffee to keep from pouring coffee all over the counter. I defy anyone to pour water into the reservoir from the carafe without spilling/splattering water outside the unit and/or into the waiting coffee grounds. The unit lid opens only to a right angle and makes it impossible to empty the entire contents of the carafe into the reservoir, even with the lid off the carafe. The unit lid prevents tilting the carafe enough to come close to pouring the designed 12 cups of water into the unit. Despite routine cleaning, the basket has begun to leak coffee, even after the brew cycle has ended, so that when the carafe is replaced after pouring it sits in a pool of coffee (that you don't notice because of the black surface) that then drips on the counter or floor when the carafe is next removed. We own other Cuisinart appliances that work well and that we enjoy, but after purchases of two different Cuisinart coffee makers, we're done with them.",ATR,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de mayo de 2018
Worst coffee maker I ever had,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","If this was my first Cuisinart I would never buy another Cuisinart. The bottom heating plate does not heat up - I mean it is built not to heat up and the water came out warm - not hot so coffee was warm and not brewed. The carafe must be soaked in boiling water first or it will cool what ever you put in it so the barely warm almost coffee turns to ice. The stainless carafe is awkward to open, fill and maneuver. The unit itself is almost impossible to fill with water and the beep signal stoped working after the first few times. I had it exchanged and the same problems with the replacement. I returned both and thank god for Amazons good service for issuing a prompt refund. Much appreciated Amazon. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.",Montreal Gal,Revisado en Canadá el 10 de noviembre de 2019
Leaks all over the place,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Coffee pools in the recessed lid of the carafe and leaks all over the place when you pour, if you don't wipe all of it out of the lid. Every time you put the carafe back on the plate, it manages to once again fill the recessed lid with coffee, which you again need to wipe out if you don't want it spilling everywhere when you pour. Also, like other reviewers have pointed out, the pour is very slow, the carafe isn't great for filling the water reservoir and you can't get all of the coffee out at the end without tipping the carafe upside down (and then it splatters all over the place). What a dumb design. Did anyone at Cuisinart actually use this before taking it to market? Will be returning it immediately.",Laura E.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de septiembre de 2023
Had to trash it after only 6 months,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",We carefully chose this product based off of customer reviews and it didn’t work out well for us. The pot didn’t pour well. Had to wipe it off after pouring every cup. Oh well. Then the machine started malfunctioning if you poured a cup of coffee before the cycle completed (an advertised feature). Oh well—just let the whole pot brew. Then water started pooling in the grounds and overflowing the machine flooding onto the counter and wood floor. This happened twice.

Flawed Design,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Two pretty important functional things about using a coffee maker:
Water goes in and coffee pours out of the carafe once it’s made. This device fails on both.
You have to turn the whole machine sideways in order to pour in water for brewing. There is some ridiculous piece of plastic that impedes pouring water into the machine without it spilling outside the machine. Secondly, once the coffee is made, the carafe drips from somewhere on your counter as you fill your coffee cup.

totally disappointed,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Update: After using this for two weeks, I'm thoroughly disgusted. I generally make six cups at a time, which translates into three mugs for me every morning. The first cup is great--what I'd expect from a Cuisinart. The second, barely drinkable. The third--well, I have to turn the carafe almost upside-down as it dribbles out a tepid cup of undrinkable sludge. I'm ordering a different coffee maker today, and hoping Amazon will allow me to return this one, although I wouldn't blame them if they don't, as I've had this sitting in my pantry since November, although it's only been in actual use for a few weeks. (Good luck to me proving that, right?) Do NOT waste your money on the 12-cup model.

My very old Cuisinart coffee maker was on its deathbed when I ordered the new, updated, ""wonderful"" 12-cup Cuisinart back in November. Well, after 10+ years, the old one finally died. I set this up, and can't say how awful this coffee maker is. With no hot plate (in spite of the answers to my query about this), the coffee gets cold way too soon. It's difficult to clean, the twist-off cover on the stainless steel carafe hurts my arthritic hands, and overall, I'm beyond disappointed.

Last one was the carafe free coffee maker, the timer and programmable options quit working after about two weeks. Now this one, the 14 cup makes all the grounds stick to the top as did the other one. And I only made 10 cups so the basket wasn’t even full…still a big mess to clean up after every pot has been made…so either I’ll spend A LOT of money on a super coffee maker or I’ll buy a single brew keurig….maybe Cuisinart should consider making the basket area a little deeper, I don’t know but this is terrible!

Pot drips - listen to poor reviews,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Where to begin - compared to what you could get for around the same money this thing is awful.

The most irritating issue is that the pot drips every time you pour a cup - coffee drips from spout, down the carafe and onto floor or counter.

Other reviewers have covered a variety of issues.

Positive reviews have noted how nice and hot the coffee is - not true. The Bonavita is much better. Even if I put hot water in the Cuisinart carafe to heat it up before making the coffee, it’s still medium hot after I add cream to my cup even when the coffee is just made.

Does NOT stay on like the description says!!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I hated this machine and am returning it. I expected a lot better for the high reviews and price.

WARNING! If you want a coffee pot that stays on, do not buy this one. I contacted Cuisinart myself and they clarified that this machine (stainless insulated) is unable to be programmed to stay on for the 0-4 hours like the description says. This was THE reason I bought it. Cuisinart told me the idea was that coffee would stay hot between 0 to 4 hours, not that it could be programmed to do so. My coffee was cold 30 minutes later. Unless you want to wake up before the automatic setting and prime your pot with hot water, you will have cold coffee. Defeats the entire purpose of an auto setting, if you ask me.

Additional items that sealed the deal on returning-
The area where you pour in the water is small, you inevitably miss and pour water everywhere.

Terrible functionality - poorly designed,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I strongly do not recommend this piece of garbage coffee maker. First off, you cannot easily use the coffee maker carafe to measure water for the reservoir. You have to guess how much water you need for the amount you want to make. Not a huge deal. I just have to now have a separate carafe that gives the measurements. Second, when I follow the directions for starting it, it doesn’t actually brew like it should, it makes a LOT of weird noises and then the smallest amount of coffee comes out. See video - that was supposed to be 6 cups. Was not even a cup of coffee. I followed the exact directions. Nothing but garbage. I’m so frustrated with this purchase.

Less than a year old and the base plate is rusted!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","We ordered this coffee maker on September 12, 2022 so we've only had it for about nine months. About a month ago we started noticing light rust spots on the plate and now it's rusted as shown in the photo.

Maybe we're to blame since we would occasionally splash some water on the plate when we filled the maker, but I would think that's a pretty common occurrence for most customers and Cuisinart would coat the plate to withstand any spills.

carage is horrible,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I have to believe that no one at Cuisinart ever attempted to use this coffee maker. When pouring coffee, the carafe sprays coffee all over the countertop. When there are only a few cups left, you have to turn the carafe nearly upside down, and even then, the coffee barely drips out.

Multiple Leaking Carafes...Immediately,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I've had this since September 2017 and it makes a great cup of coffee, stays hot forever and tastes great...in the beginning. However, after a couple weeks the pot began to leak at the joint below the pour spout, which causes coffee to drip everywhere when pouring (and water when filling the tank). After 3 weeks of back and forth with the Cuisinart warranty folks (due to their 5-day lag in response time, plus asking for bits of info each time), they finally sent out a replacement. 2-3 weeks later, and the second one started leaking! Unbelievable. This is just normal use, they simply get rinsed and placed back in the holder after use. Both were still basically brand new looking when the leaks happened, didn't even have long enough to clean. Luckily the cuisinart folks accidentally (or thoughtfully?) sent me two replacements. So I'm now on the third pot in about 4 months of use (average of about 4x per week).

Edit: Third pot now leaking in the same location. Unbelievable, and I'm not sure how everyone doesn't have the same issue (though many certainly do, it seems this leak is what causes the pour to splash all over the place...it pours fine before the seal is compromised).

Poorly Designed,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I wish I had opened this a lot sooner because I would have returned it right away.

It has a few glaring design flaws, most notably the carafe. Why do I have to flip it upside down to pour? That makes no sense. And pouring out the last cup is nearly impossible without literally sloshing it around back and forth upside down. The non-removable cover makes cleaning the inside difficult as well. You have to reach inside the little hole when the cover is off. The power cord is also incredibly short.

GOOD
1. The programming of time and auto-brew was easy.
2. The LED was highly visible and easy to read.

BAD
1. The water tank is hard to fill using the provided carafe. The carafe is bulky and makes adding water hard. Getting 100% of the water from the carafe to the water tank was 100% impossible. I ended up using a seperate water bottle.

Cheap cheap cheap!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I did a decent amount of research and though I wanted a coffee maker that was three times this price, I compromised with my spouse and settled on this one. Our previous one (and many other kitchen items) are Cuisinart and I read the reviews here on Amazon. It was just time upgrade and I have always wanted a thermal coffee carafe.

Very Poor Design,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I’ll start by saying in all the years I have purchased things on Amazon I have never written a review. This product has such a poor design that I felt obligated to hopefully save someone else from making the same mistake I made. The coffee maker does not have a heating plate so it does not provide a heat source that will keep the coffee hot for any reasonable amount of time. As a result, the coffee reaches Lukewarm temperatures after around an hour and fifteen minutes of being made. You cannot use the coffee pot to fill the coffee maker reservoir without leaving a significant amount of water in the coffee pot. To get all the water (if you are filling the reservoir) or coffee (if you are trying to empty the pot) out of the coffee pot you have to turn the coffee pot completely upside down which results in losing all control of where the liquid you are pouring out goes.

1. Fill the thermal pot with boiling water and let it sit for a few moments to warm up.
2. Make at least 10 cups of coffee.
3. Drink 4 of them in a couple of hours.
4. Discard the remaining 6 cups.

Nope. I bought a new Keurig, and will use the attachment that allows you to avoid buying the pods. I'll keep this machine around for entertaining.",SandyStern,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de febrero de 2019
"Awkward, heavy and frustrating","1,0 de 5 estrellas","Whoever designed this pot was hoping to curb your love of coffee. The cafe is so heavy and awkward to pour from that you will waste at least half of your pot because it DOESN'T come out! You have to turn the carafe completely over and tip it in a circular manner to get the last two cups out (hint, do it over the sink--it's a mess). There is no way to completely clean the carafe either, unless you have a small child who would dare to stick their hand in. The top is a leaky mess as well. If you take it off, you will drip grounds and crud all over the counter. You absolutely have to use a filter (although it says you don't) as the metal filter allows grounds into your cup. Nothing like chewy coffee. Also, if you don't have the filter in completely right, nor the top screwed in completely, you'll have a disaster waiting for you in the morning. Fun.

too many grounds,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",i generally like cuisinart products but this one is a bust. the instruction book mentions that grounds can gather in the bottom of the carafe. we tried both paper and gold filter and grounds always accumulated in the carafe. the carafe is heavy and doesnt pour well. you cant see how much coffee is left in it. we constantly had coffee drip on the counter. they advise you to run hot water in the carafe to warm it up. the clean light went on after 10 pots which seems a little short time wise. we were so disappointed that i ordered a different brand and sent this one to the basement,Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de agosto de 2023
Terrible Carafe Design,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","PRO: Coffee taste is pretty good.
CON: Carafe is difficult to clean as the neck is very narrow. It is also very heavy and hard to pour. You have to tip halfway over before coffee starts to come out, and you have to make sure the spout is close to your cup as the coffee ""sprays"" a bit. My carafe also leaks at the band between the spout and the body of the carafe.",Cindy,Revisado en Canadá el 20 de octubre de 2021

poor design,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I have been using this coffee pot for 2 months now. It does make a good flavor cup of coffee but using the coffee pot is difficult. The carafe that holds the coffee is the worst design I have ever seen. The rim of the carafe has a 1-inch lip! So, in order to get the last of the coffee out, you have to turn the carafe upside down and the coffee goes everywhere. You also can't use the carafe to fill the maker with water for the same reason. The spot to pour the water into the maker is tiny and you have no control over where the water goes due to the lip in the carafe. There wasn't much of a choice for a 12-cup thermal carafe but I would rather make 2 smaller pots than deal with this mess of a design. Just not worth the effort.",Doreen Sousa,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de marzo de 2022
Very Poor Design - Lacks Ease of Use - Not Worth It,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Sad product design, lacks common sense. We wanted to like this coffee pot, but too difficult to use even when fully awake.
- Difficult to pour from carafe because the opening is on the very top of the pot, means I have to turn it UPSIDE DOWN to pour out the last few cups or fully empty the container.
- It's very difficult to fill the tank with water using the actual coffee pot, as noted above, so we must use the kitchen sprayer hose instead in order to fill water tank.
- Deal breaker - There is a small plastic ""cap"" that sits on top of the lid and falls off very easily. Trouble is, this cap is required to allow coffee to flow into the pot. If the cap is missing when coffee is perking, the coffee does NOT flow into the carafe/pot, but instead overflows spilling coffee grounds into the water tank, all over the counter, etc. Meaning the whole process must be redone, after cleaning coffee grounds out of water tank and so forth.

Stopped while testing, then started clicking again when real coffee run thru it. so noisy it wakes me up in the morning. And the ""done brewing"" signal is so loud it can't be used. Coffee is mediocre at best but could be because of an off brand we tried. The pot does not have a warmer but relies on the insulated carafe. I would prefer a warmer.

The carafe is the weak link,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this to replace an old Braun insulated carafe coffee maker. I bought this item because it seemed similar - insulated carafe, makes about the same about of coffee, plus this version has a timer so you can set it to auto-start the next morning, which my Braun did not have!

Generally, I'm happy with the machine itself. It's the carafe that's so frustrating, and really demonstrates the gap between the Braun and this model.

First, the ergonomics of it - you have to tip the carafe nearly all the way over to get the coffee to come out, which means that that any liquid that's formed on the top of the lid (and there will always be some from the drip mechanism) will spill out and fall on the floor/your hand. Why do you have to tip this thing so far? The Braun had a much easier and logical tip angle to empty it out.

Worse, because of how far you have to tip it to get the liquid out, you cannot use the carafe to fill the water reservoir! The lid of the reservoir doesn't open up that far, and because of how far you have to tip the carafe to empty it, you will find that the lid prevents you from positioning the carafe over the reservoir enough to empty it out. Which means you have to find something else to fill the reservoir. Just poor design and planning.

Lastly, I brewed a few cups, had one cup before I walked my daughter to school (a 15-minute round trip), and when I topped off my coffee cup, discovered that the coffee in the carafe was only lukewarm. After less than an hour! The old Braun would keep coffee hotter for longer.

So really, I'm very disappointed in the carafe. If they could fix the ergonomics and insulation, this would be a great maker. But the carafe is just too poor to recommend this maker.",C. Vaughan,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de junio de 2023
"Lousy coffee, poorly designed carafe","2,0 de 5 estrellas","I have limited counter space. I needed a coffee maker with a small footprint, and nowadays most coffee makers are as big as microwave ovens. I thought that Cuisinart, a trusted brand, would make a decent cup of coffee. Wrong. This makes such anemic, watery coffee that I am now basically using it as an expensive pour-over filter cone holder and carafe. Selecting the 'bold' button does nothing that I can discern. I kept trying to adjust the flavor by using more and more coffee, up to a third more than I did with the 20-year-old white plastic Braun maker that this was intended to replace, and the coffee was still lousy. I am now heating water on my stovetop and pouring it over the grounds in this machine and into the carafe. How hard can it be to design a machine that heats water to the correct temperature for decent coffee? Very hard, apparently. The carafe is also poorly designed. It drips and spills unpredictably when pouring, even on the first cup. You have to tilt it well past the vertical, and even when you turn it upside down you can't get all the coffee to pour out. It does not hold heat for very long (even though I always preheat the carafe with very hot water). The repeated 'ready' tone that it emits is loud and piercing; I immediately turned it off. This machine is very disappointing, a waste of money. OTOH, if you like to drink warm brown water, it is simple to operate.",LaProfesora,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de diciembre de 2023
Poor carafe design splatters coffee everywhere when pouring,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this to replace a 20-year old earlier version of this Cuisinart coffee maker that performed well. Onnthis uodated version, the carafe is a little bigger, which seems to make the design flaw even worse. Because of the curve just below the opening that makes a ""well"" inside the carafe leading up to the spout, it's impossible to pour the last cup out of the carafe without turning it completely upside-down, which usually results in the coffee splattering everywhere. The same design flaw prevents you from using the carafe to fill the water reservoir by emptying the carafe containing water - once you pour most of the water into the reservoir, there's about a cup or so of water that can't be poured out, since it's ""stuck"" behind this interior ""wall"".
What's even more annoying is that every cup poured beyond the first cup, results in some amount of coffee coming out the sides of the spout, splattering coffee drops everywhere.
I know - first world problems - but clearly this is poor desugn. Had I not had the previous version of this coffee maker for so long, perhaps I wouldn't have an expectation that this new version would perform better. It doesn't. This experience has made me cautious about buying any other Cuisinart products.",David W. Kramer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de diciembre de 2023
Not as good as the prior model,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","So, this is a nice looking coffee maker with some nice features, including the clean function, auto-programming, and ability to make 1 to 4 cups instead of a full pot. I owned the prior model of this same coffee maker for over 8 years and made good coffee. The problem is that the coffee from this new model just tastes bad. After several times cleaning, I couldn't get all of the flame retardant plastic taste out of the coffee. There also seems to be something wrong with the brew temperature. If you're looking at this coffee maker, coffee must be important to you, since you're paying a higher price. I can honestly say that the Mr. Coffee that we use in the coffee club at work makes way better coffee.

Now after just a couple of months, the carafe leaks at the top.

Also, when opening the lid to put in a filter, more coffee, etc. for the next day, the raised lid leaks a lot of condensation, running down the back of the machine and all over the counter.

I had high expectations for this coffeepot. I bought one for my travel trailer and really, really liked it.

This second one seems to be ""almost right"".

* It doesn't get the coffee as hot as my first one
* It doesn't keep the coffee hot for as long as my first one
* The first one made good coffee with one standard coffee scoop per mug. This one requires 1.5 or more scoops of coffee for good (strong) coffee. That is with the ""bold"" setting.

Coffee maker=good. Thermal carafe=terrible!,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a review of the Cuisinart DCC-3400 12-cup coffeemaker with a thermal carafe (not a glass carafe).

I like the coffeemaker itself. Controls are large enough to identify easily and are clearly labeled. It's easy to set the time and program. And the coffee is good--at least to my pedestrian taste.

I decided to get the thermal carafe so that the coffee would stay hot without slowly cooking and acquiring that burned taste. That was a BIG mistake. Should have gone with glass.

The carafe is heavy--over 2 pounds empty, over 5 pounds full. The top of the carafe measures 5 inches in diameter. But there's a plastic ""collar"" on the top (see the photo), and the opening is a little less than 2.5 inches. That means the carafe is awkward to handle. And it has to be turned almost upside down to pour the last cup or two. The small opening makes the carafe very difficult to clean. After two hours, the coffee is quite warm, but is not hot. More than that and a few seconds in a microwave may be required.

In short, I would buy the coffeemaker again, but with a glass carafe.",Ron M,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de septiembre de 2023

Does not keep coffee warm,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee-maker was a disappointment. First, although we are not devoted to super-hot coffee, the coffee quickly becomes too cool to enjoy, even for us. Once the coffee is in the carafe, it is not heated. If you preheat the carafe with boiling water before you make coffee, it stays warmer longer, but if you just make the coffee with a cold carafe, it becomes too cool to be palatable very quickly. Boiling water, filling the carafe, and then making coffee is really not an acceptable solution, although it is better than making coffee in a cold carafe. Second, there is no good way to measure the amount of water to put into the coffee maker just using the carafe and the machine. With our last coffee-maker (and every other coffee-maker we have ever owned), the carafe was glass, so you could use the carafe to measure the water you wanted and pour it into the machine from the carafe. Because this is a metal carafe, there is no way to know precisely how much water is in the carafe -- you need to use a separate measuring cup to fill the water reservoir. And even if you want to make a full pot of coffee, you cannot just fill the carafe and pour it into the reservoir because of the temperature problem described above. I guess you could fill the reservoir, then add boiling water from some other source to the carafe until it is preheated and then make coffee, but that would be a real hassle -- and waste a lot of water. Third, I do not know why anyone would think that this is machine is easy to clean. It is true that the basket and filter are relatively easy to remove and put in the dishwasher, but the carafe has proven to be impossible to clean completely. We faithfully rinse the carafe after each use and then soak it for a few minutes with hot water and dishwashing soap. The metal interior of the carafe has nevertheless become covered with coffee stains. Because the neck of the carafe is smaller than most human hands, it is impossible to scrub the interior of the pot to remove the stains. We have been using this coffee-maker for over a year and there is really no solution to any of these problems, so I think we will just toss this and start over with something that has a glass carafe and a heating element that keeps it warm after the coffee is made. I do not understand how anyone could think that this is a good coffee-maker.",TLA,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de diciembre de 2019

"DOES NOT POUR, JUST SPILLS","2,0 de 5 estrellas","So, after lots of research against the very few other insulated carafe models out there, this is the only decent option. Been using this coffee pot for two years, and it makes coffee, and keeps it hot.

It does have a major atrocious design flaw. The poor spout on this pot DOES NOT POUR.

It is amazing. I have to pour cups of coffee while holding the cup over the sink otherwise you get a steady dribble of coffee that runs down the front of the pot and pours all over the floor, counter, table, feet, pets, children, books, you name it. And no, the coffee pot does not leak, several friends with the same pot, all have the same frustration. If you can pour coffee at the slowest possible dribble, this can sometimes be avoided if the pot is only half full.

This one coffee pot single handedly has caused more people to cause more coffee stains on more things than every other coffee maker in history combined (scientific data confirms this!).
It is amazing that the basic design of a pour spout, something that has been created for thousands of years, has so effectively eluded the Cuisinart engineers! I have seen handmade pottery teapots made by seven year old children that could pour liquid more effectively than this coffee pot!

So that being said, know what you are in for, don't spill all over yourself on your way to work, or ruin that book you're reading. Otherwise it's a coffee pot that works as intended, but I would gladly pay twice as much for a unit infused with the ancient, and apparently elusive, pour spout technology!",Kai,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de agosto de 2021
"I wanted to like it, but I didn't.","2,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this coffee maker to replace an decade old Krups machine. I had smashed to Krups carafe but the machine was acting up, so I thought it didn't make sense for me to buy a new carafe if I was looking at buying a new machine. Also I thought I should buy something that I would have a lesser likelihood of smashing carafes (this is a constant problem for me). So I bought this machine with the thermal carafe. I hate it. The machine does not get the water as hot as the previous machine, so the coffee not brewed as well and is not as flavorful even on bold brewing. Also, the filter constantly overflows which gets grounds in the coffee, and I have to use less coffee, which compounds the problem. Occasionally if the filter overflows, it jams up the mechanism and water won't leave the filter to go into the coffee pot and overflows onto the counter. Now let's talk about the carafe. You can't use it to fill the coffee maker because of the weird construction. Okay, I read that in a review before I bought it and thought, no big, I'll just fill it with another container, and have been using mason jar to fill it up. However, what I didn't realize is that problem also makes it damn near impossible to get all of the coffee out of the carafe into a cup or thermos so you have to make more so that you can pour it without dumping it all over your counter. I'm generally a pretty frugal person, and I generally will put up with a crappy appliance until it breaks, because I hate spending money to replace something that works, but I cannot take it anymore. I've had this coffee maker for just about 7 months, and I've just ordered a replacement.

Worst Carafe Design from this Trusted Long Time Consumer Brand,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","How did this coffee maker get a near-perfect rating?
First, this machine is difficult to use. To fill the reservoir, the water must be poured carefully, into a small 2"" x 3"" odd-shaped opening at the back of the top of the unit, wedged into the top's hinge. If you miss this opening, the water goes right down to the base of the machine, and you have a cleanup task. You need a container with a narrow spout to fill this machine. This is not supplied with the coffee maker.
Second, when pouring the coffee, it pours out in a very small stream-see picture. It's a long, slow pour. Third, the carafe has a shape that makes it impossible to pour the last cup or two. Those last cups require you to invert the carafe (see picture), and you have another cleanup.
It took some experimentation to get the right amount of coffee grounds to use for a full flavor. The first three cycles of coffee tasted horrible. This is because the markings on the side of the machine are not accurate. I filled the machine with 4 U.S. Cups of water using a cook's measuring cup. The coffee machine indicates that is ""6"". So the cup indicator on side of machine is false.
All of this is very disappointing for such an old and trusted brand name. It works, but it's a weak product.",brianfred,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de marzo de 2022

After we discovered our last coffee maker leaking water all over the counter and found the bottom covered in rust after just a couple of years we picked this one for the thermal carafe in lieu of the constantly cracking glass one. It looks really nice and elegant and it brews a fine cup of coffee. The problem is when you try to pour from the carafe

You have to literally turn it almost completely upside down and even then the coffee trickled out at such an inconsistent flow that it splashes all over the place. I mean everywhere. I tried to outsmart it and just remove the lid and try pouring that way. Much worse, I don't recommend that. So now, I am suck with a carafe that I can drop on the floor vs the one that breaks of the sun comes up, but I have to keep a dish towel under the cup to catch all of the splashing and spilling that occurs.

It is impossible to pour a cup of coffee without having to wipe up the resulting mess with a sponge.

Only after buying this coffee maker did I read the reviews and saw that a number of people had the same problem. PRO TIP: Was going to eat the cost and buy a different coffee maker but decided to first call Cuisinart Customer Service.

"GRINDS IN COFFEE, DOESN'T STAY PROGRAMMED AND *VERY* HARD TO GET THE LAST CUP OF COFFEE OUT","2,0 de 5 estrellas","There is no question that this is a sturdy coffeemaker and we appreciate the thermal carafe........HOWEVER.....it's impossible to get *all* the coffee in the pot out of it. Coffee gets hung up on the inner contours of the carafe and the only way is to take the lid off and then tip the pot completely over to try to get the rest of it out. There is a huge inner ledge that it has to get around. The carafe is VERY hard to clean for the same reason.

Also......we onlhy make 6 cups or the equivalent of 3 mugs. Coffee grinds overflow into the coffee itself.

The machine itself does not stay programmed. It has to be reset EVERY night and then when the coffee is done brewing the next morning all the lights go out and the programming is canceled. The only thing that stays set is the time. This defies the whole idea of programming it to start brewing at the same time every day. It seems like a lot was put into this coffee maker to make it more expensive but by far anything but convenient.

I will give it this......our coffee tastes WAY better. This is the only reason for 2 stars.....that and how sturdy the machine is. Otherwise, if I could I would give this ""minus star"".

If you want a coffee maker that automatically turns on every day at the same time, this is not the one.

Original:
After three months of daily use, we are not very happy with this coffee maker. We wanted a 12 cup thermos style coffee maker that would keep coffee warm until midday. This item fits the requirements well and we have had other Cuisinart products that we’ve loved but this one is a pain to use. First of all, it’s very hard to fill because the top doesn’t open past straight up but the water inlet is in the back. So using the carafe to fill the water is awkward at best and most often results in spilling some water. Second, pouring coffee almost always dribbles down the side. We’re in the habit of pouring a cup over the sink to avoid coffee splatter on the counter. Finally, good luck getting the last cup of coffee out without making a mess - you have to turn the carafe completely upside down and it still doesn’t really empty well. Temp is good and flavor is pretty good but not the best. It does keep the coffee fairly warm throughout the morning as well.

Just a pain to use,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Our old Cuisinart coffee maker got a lot of use for a lot of years, and we were super happy with it, so when it finally gave up, we didn't hesitate to order this one. What a disappointment.

Does it make good coffee? Yup. Are the ""bold"" and ""1-4 cup"" features cool to have? Sure.

But it has a couple of ridiculous design flaws that make it so irritating to use. First, the access lid on the top of the coffee maker only opens to about 90 degrees and the opening to fill the water reservoir is small, and right next to the lid hinge, so it's nearly impossible to get the carafe positioned to pour water into the reservoir. We frequently wind up pouring a bunch of water down the side of the coffee maker or directly into the filter basket. And second, if the carafe is more than about half full, you have to pour very, very slowly or coffee runs down the side of the carafe and all over the counter.

These problems aren't the end of the world, but they are pretty irritating. Especially when I know, from our previous coffee maker, that they were problems that Cuisinart had already solved in the past.",Peter Oxley,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de febrero de 2022
"Keep a rag nearby, you'll need it.","2,0 de 5 estrellas","First, I never made a single pot of coffee with this, my review is about the design of the thermal carafe and unit. My intention was to run several brews of just water to get the new plastic taste out. Looking at the design of the carafe I could see cleaning it might be a challenge as the lip is so thick inside I wouldn't be able to reach it easily with a sponge. I filled it with water and put the lid on. The lid is an awkward design as well, doesn't easily come on and off without some jiggering. Then comes the pour into the coffee maker. It takes a minute to get my aim zeroed in on the little opening but I figured it out, until the last 1/8 or so of the pour. It's at this point you have to turn the pot almost completely upside down, problem is the flip lid on the unit does not open enough to accommodate the size of the pot. Water then goes into the wrong reservoir and/or on the counter. I tried half a dozen times at different angles, same result. Unless you are a pouring jiu jitsu master you will start your day with a sloppy mess on the counter. No thanks, I sent it packing. Mornings are hard enough. Oh, and the directions suggest you have the carafe pre-warmed as there is no heat on the plate pad. I always get my water filtered from the fridge so this would mean I would need to run the carafe under warm water to take the chill off. You really dropped the ball on this design Cuisinart.",Happy Robot,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de julio de 2020

Further than that, I'm disappointed that this coffee maker doesn't actually keep your coffee hot.
The whole reason I bought it was so that I could come back later for another cup of coffee and not have to remake it.
The coffee is not kept hot enough so when you add milk, it becomes luke warm. I'm not into microwaving my coffee.

Also, it is slow to pour and you have to literally turn it upside down to get the last of the coffee out of the pot. My husband hates it.

Poor carafe design,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I am returning this coffee maker without even brewing a single cup of coffee.

I opted for this machine because I have an almost identical model with a glass carafe, and the warming plate has started to rust. I opted for the thermal carafe this time because warming plates tend to burn the coffee as it sits over the course of a few hours. I tested the machine with water first as directed by the instruction manual. The carafe has an easy to open lid, and the carafe itself is VERY heavy and seemingly well insulated. So why return it?

1. The coffee maker heating plate still activates and heats up the carafe. Not only is this self-defeating as it eliminates the advantage of the thermal carafe (no burnt coffee), it should be completely unnecessary if the thermal carafe is doing its job. My only guess is Cuisinart only swaps the carafe and the rest of the machine is identical.
2. And this one really blew my mind. There simply is no way to get all of the coffee out of the carafe without removing the lid. I did not measure, but I would estimate almost a full cup of coffee remains in the carafe, even if you fully invert it. Once you remove the lid, there is no guarantee where the coffee is going to pour, because there is no internal lip.

Pot design kills an otherwise excellent pot...,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Review is for the 12 Cup Thermos Version...Glass version likely doesn't have the same issues.
I never brewed a pot of coffee before returning the unit, so I cannot say how well the coffee tates. Coffee maker itself is easy to use, brews at a decent rate, isn't too loud and is fairly easy to clean.

No complaints.

Thermos Carafe; however, sucks big time and is the entire reason I returned the unit. To start, and this is only a minor quibble, it isn't nearly as easy to open as it should be. While not horrible, I would caution anyone with weak or arthritic hands to avoid. Shame, too, because it would be so easy to fix by adding a small thumb tab on the lid. The bigger issue is the way it is designed to avoid needing some kind of manual thumb tab to allow it to poor. The designed the lid is such a way the the the whole used to pour out the coffee is off center on a piece of the lid. That translates into not being able to get several ounces of coffee to pour out without tilting back up the pot and trying over and over...even then you almost always have to remove the lid to get the last oz or so out.

I cannot fathom how this got past Q&A and Product Test...it is that dumb.

Great if your arms can dislocate at will,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This is great in almost every way, but one. And it’s a big one: the pot design . In order to pour, it must be turned completely upside down at an angle that is, at best, extremely awkward and uncomfortable. It forces your arm into some kind of position that would be perfect for extracting answers from a captured spy. It makes NO sense. Why is it designed like this? I suppose it’s possible that I’m just doing it wrong, but then, it’s a COFFEE POT. How dumb would I have to be to need help with that?? It probably works just fine if you fill the whole pot up and only want to pour two cups. But once you get down below 50%, it’s a mess. And besides, if you put more than 6 cups worth of grounds in this thing it just causes an overflow and a huge mess, so you can’t really go higher than 25% capacity.

Thermal carafe is a huge pain,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","The stainless steel thermal carafe does a very good job keeping coffee hot very several hours at least. Unfortunately, it is nevertheless a huge pain and I do not recommend it.

Because of the way the top seals, when you pour the coffee out it splatters in all directions and almost always makes a mess. The last bit of coffee (roughly 1 cup) cannot be poured out at all without taking the lid off and turning the carafe entirely upside down over the sink, so you will always waste that last bit.

Finally, because it pours so badly, you cannot use the carafe to fill up the water tank. You will either need to carry the full machine over to your water source or use a separate pitcher to fill it up.",Reader,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de julio de 2023

Check the positive reviews…how long have they owned it? I’ve had it for 2 years. It gets worse,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","So at first this 12 cup with Thermal carafe was a good machine. Yes the spout has a design flaw where it leaks and dribbles, but I poured it over the sink and dealt with it. Yes, the carafe is hard to clean but I bought a baby bottle brush and dealt with it. The coffee tasted great and it stayed hot a long time and was easy to program.

Within the first year it started randomly leaking coffee along the base, while it was filling up. Not every time so I dealt with it. Now I just reached my second year owning it, and the leaking has increased and the stop function to get a cup while it’s percolating has stoppped working. So more coffee is leaking all over the counter. It is now basically useless and I’m back on Amazon looking for a new 12 cup machine after having owned this for 2 years.

Lacking sensible features,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This is in regards to the model DCC-3400 Stainless Steel Thermal Coffeemaker, 12 Cup Carafe.
Finding a good, reasonably priced coffee pot with thermal carafe is hard, especially in a 10 to 12 cup size. I thought this was going to be a good solution to my old Mr. Coffee pot that I loved, but need to replace.
I was wrong.
This pot does not have a separate lid to pour the water in; water is filled in the same area you place the grounds basket so if you're not careful, you splash water everywhere, including on the grounds. Not good if you want to program for overnight. Leave the grounds basket out while filling and you can easily pour straight into the plate the pot sits on, splashing water everywhere.
The carafe is awkward in size and shape. It lacks a button to press to dispense your coffee so if you accidentally tip the pot a little while carrying it, it spills. The coffee also pours out weird and almost splashes out. And if you tip the pot too far, coffee spills back out the catch in the top of the carafe where the coffee drips in as it is made. Just an overall poor design.
The beeper to alert you that coffee is done is LOUD and long.
The only thing this pot has going for it is that it keeps the coffee HOT for a long time and the brew strength is great.

Worked great ... until it didn't,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this coffee maker because I wanted a thermal carafe and it was one of the few models that allowed you to turn off the ""done brewing"" notification beep. Why do coffee maker companies think that's something we want? My husband and I sometimes wake up very early, and we don't have a giant suburban McMansion, so any beeps like that are bound to wake up the whole d-mn house.

Though this coffee maker sometimes woke us up anyway--it's pretty loud when it's brewing.

At any rate, it worked pretty well. Made good, strong-tasting coffee and the carafe, while a little dribbly, kept the coffee warm for a long time--which, again, is good when one of you wakes up at 4:30 a.m. and one of you at 7.

But after less than three years, the whole unit went kaput. It started brewing only two cups of the water and then shutting off. The coffee started tasting worse. And then it wasn't even hot anymore when it was brewed. And yes, I cleaned it. I cleaned it like 6 times in a row trying to see if some sort of clog or hard-water buildup was the culprit. I went through an entire jug of vinegar. Nothing doing.

Bottom line: This is a four-star machine for 2-3 years, then it's a piece of junk. For the price Cuisinart is charging, this thing should last longer.",Editrixie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de noviembre de 2020

Today getting close to two year mark, it turns off during the brew before finishing. I guess time to look for another, cheaper maker.

Bad design leads to spills,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been using a $20 Mr Coffee for the last 12 years, and this is a downgrade.

The carafe is broken by design. It's short and squat, and the opening is very small, so you have to turn it fully upside down to pour all the liquid out. This leads to spills both when filling the tank, and pouring your coffee. This probably isn't as big of an issue if you make full pots, but it's a big issue if you only make 4 cups or less at a time.

The basket has to be perfectly aligned or else the water will overflow your filter and leave you with a ton of grounds in your coffee. The grounds will clog the basket's valve and defeat the ""auto-stop"" mechanism, so you'll end up with a cup of boiling hot coffee on your counter if you try to grab a cup before it's done brewing.

HORRIFICLY FLAWED Carafe Design,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee maker boasts an attractive compact design, simple operation, and thermal carafe that keeps coffee hot for hours. But don't be fooled... this thing sucks! The problem -- and it is a BIG annoyance -- is the design of the carafe. The top has a very wide rim that extends around the entire circumference of the carafe, with only a 2-inch hole in the middle through which to pour coffee. The result is that the carafe must be held virtually upside down to pour coffee into a cup. The photo shows the angle at which coffee starts to slowly flow from the carafe -- with the top removed. I presume the intent of this design is to minimize heat transfer -- but the trade-off to practicality and ease-of-use is significant. Not only is simply pouring a cup of coffee awkward and excruciatingly slow, but I have to brew at least an extra 8 -10 ounces left in the carafe after pouring as much as possible.",Malcolm Jacobson,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de septiembre de 2021

Perfect coffee Maker.....Except-Not,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I was so excited when I found a coffeemaker that had everything I wanted. And it does. Not much steam so I can place it under my cabinets, 12 cups capacity, programable, thermal carafe. This is the third coffee maker that I will be returning. We like pretty strong coffee but the capacity of the coffee filter causes the grounds to bubble up and spill into the pot, on the inside, on the bottom of the carafe, inside the carafe into the water- just everywhere. I am going to try it with some coarse ground coffee and see if that solves the problem. If not, I will return it. I would think that if you make a 12 cup coffeemaker, it should be capable of holding the coffee needed to make the 12 cups.

Update: I brewed about 2.5 cups this morning and the coffee grounds did not come up over the top so I ordered #6 filters and am going to try that next. The only other option I can think of is to brew two batches of 6 cups which again defeats the purpose of having a 12 cup coffee maker. Will send another update if/when I find a solution.",Jane,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de noviembre de 2019
This pot does not pour easily,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee pot brews a nice cup of coffee, however, when it comes to pouring the coffee it fails miserably.

The Thermal Carafe doesn't keep coffee hot for very long.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased my 2nd Cuisinart Thermal Carafe coffee maker in July 2019 because I was so happy with my one one. The reason I loved it was because it really kept my coffee hot for a couple of hours. After it stopped working after about 5 years, I purchased another despite reading the reviews that the more current version doesn't keep the coffee hot like the initial version. This morning as I was pouring my 2nd cup of coffee into a mug to heat in the microwave, I was prompted to write a review to share this information. If you are purchasing this to keep your coffee hot for a few hours, I cannot recommend it.

Difficult pouring,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","It makes coffee fine, thermal carafe keeps it warm. My main complaint is the carafe. Do not use the carafe to fill the water tank... you will make a big mess. The large carafe does not pour well; to empty it you need to turn it almost upside down. I have to have a dedicated pitcher for filling the coffeemaker. That difficult pouring extends to serving the coffee... you pretty well lose 1-cup to impossibility of draining the contents from the carafe. And it also drips while pouring... keep a dish-rag close.

The electrical cord is a little short... with the awkwardness of filling the tank I need a little more free space to pour.

Not worth the price,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I have never written a review on Amazon before, and I am an active shopper. I have had this coffee maker for 6+ months and I have decided that the convenience of having the thermal carafe is not worth the trouble associated with this model. It brews coffee fine. I have no issue with the taste of the coffee at all. So, the annoyance I have with the machine may be workable for you but I have decided it is a pain. There is no good way to pour the coffee from this carafe without it spilling out the sides. With the lid still on I have to pour over the sink and still loose a lot of coffee, and without the lid works but when the coffee has just been made the lid is too hot to take off, and if you do take it off there is coffee on that so if you put it in anywhere other than the sink... coffee stains. I have white counters so this problem is extremely frustrating as I am constantly wiping down the counters to prevent staining thanks to this coffee maker.

There is no easy way I have found to pour coffee with ease from the carafe.

It is very difficult to pour! Don't buy!,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Very poor carafe design makes the coffee come out in a very slow stream. It really takes a while to pour a mug full. In addition, to fill the water reservoir and pour out brewed coffee you have to tilt the carafe past 90 degrees to get anything out. It is uncomfortable to hold a full carafe at that angle. Filling is very difficult. The lid goes straight up and it is a side fill. You are pouring into a small area and hindered by the lid being in the way.
We were shocked that a coffee maker of this price was engineered so poorly. The coffee is fantastic. That is why it gets two stars.

Dumbest carafe design EVER!,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This machine makes good, strong coffee. Plus, it was the only one that fit our requirements of a 12 cup, stainless carafe. However, the carafe design is so dumb! You can NOT get the last cup or two without spilling it all over the place. This is true with the screw top on or off. The perfectly round opening on the carafe has a 360° lip that is at least an inch to the interior edge of the carafe. The pour spout is wide and shallow. So, when the pot is full the shallow spout design causes the stream to overshoot your cup. Then when you get to the end of the pot—with still a good cup or two in there—the deep lip of the opening prevents you from tipping the coffee out. You have to—literally—turn the carafe upside down to get the coffee out. And good luck doing that! It spills all over the place.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de junio de 2021

Poor carafe design leads to frustration,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","We got this thermal carafe model because we were tired of pouring our extra coffee into a separate carafe to keep it warm, instead of leaving the pot on and over-cooking it. While this coffeemaker makes decent coffee, the carafe itself is the problem. When there is still about a full cup left of coffee inside, you literally can't empty out the carafe without unscrewing the lid and turning the carafe practically upside down to get the liquid out. Given this awkwardness, coffee drips and spills when you do this. Poor design. In addition, after a week of use, we've noticed that the carafe -- as beefy as it appears to be -- does not actually keep coffee all that warm after an hour or so. Our separate carafe (20 years old) keeps coffee nice a hot all morning, if necessary. Also, the old carafe pours out completely and easily. As for the coffee itself, as noted, it's decent but I don't believe it extracts quite as much coffee flavor as our older model (also a Cuisinart). Why that is, I have no idea.

When pouring the coffee, the bottom part of the container (there is a seam there) seems to accumulate water and constantly leaks when pouring - leaving coffee drips on my counter. Same happens if you put it in the dishwasher to clean it...drips everywhere. Also, when you have about a 1/3 of a pot left, it is very difficult to get it to pour out - need to take the lid off.

Disappointed :-{,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I ordered this when my trusty Mr.Coffee suddenly died. I was encouraged by all the great reviews on Amazon, and the fact that this coffee maker is on just about all of the ""best coffee makers 2019"" lists. I also liked the looks, which coordinate well with the rest of our stainless steel appliances.
First the good-- this does indeed make good coffee. It was nice and hot and it stayed hot for a long time in the carafe. That second thing was kind of a moot point because I'm in the habit of transferring freshly brewed coffee into a thermal carafe anyway. I drink hi-test and my wife takes decaf, so I transfer coffee to two different carafes and leaving it in the Cuisinart carafe would be inconvenient for one or the other of us.
About that carafe-- it's much heavier than I anticipated,especially when filled. Not a deal breaker but something to consider if you have any hand/arm weakness. It's design has two flaws that really annoyed me. The coffee comes out of the filter onto a sort of well on the lid of the carafe. The bottom of the well is flat,maybe very slightly slanted towards the center. As a result, when I took the carafe out to pour a cup there was always coffee sitting in the well which would then slop out when I started to pour, usually onto the plate beneath the carafe, or the countertop. If I swirled the pot a bit before pouring I could get that coffee to go into the carafe, but that really shouldn't be necessary.
The carafe has a sort of shoulder inside where the steel meets the plastic and this makes it impossible to fully empty without turning the carafe completely upside down. After using the carafe to fill the reservoir with water, I had to go back to the sink to dump out the remaining water which was a pain in the butt.
A couple of days ago I brewed a pot of coffee using the BOLD setting. When I tried to brew a second pot of decaf, BOLD did not work. That,for me, was the deal breaker as I always use the BOLD setting on any coffee maker.
Also, my humble Mr.Coffee kept that BOLD setting unless I changed it, but on the Cuisinart I had to hit the BOLD button every time. I can't imagine why they made it work this way. Back it goes!",Paul B.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de enero de 2020

Pours the first 10 cups just fine.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","To begin, I like the Cuisinart products I currently own and based on this I made the assumption of security in purchasing a coffee maker from the same people who brought us the food processor. When making appliance purchases I must take into account my bride likes frufru stuff. (I could care less how it looks. Mr. Coffee doesn't offend my sense of aesthetics and produces an adequate consumable fluid.) As a result, we have purchased Krups Coffee Systems in the past as a noncompromise compromise. As you have likely deduced, I'm not a coffee snob and as such am not qualified to comment on flavor, etc. I'm more focused on function and therefore will restrict my comments to that realm. Here it goes:
1. It makes coffee. So it's got that going for it.
2. I like the metal basket. It doesn't require a filter and rinses out easily enough.
3. The control panel is not as intuitive as it could be. I've had it 3 days now and preflight the coffee every night as is my custom and have yet to wake up to fresh brewed coffee. I'm confident there's something in the as-yet-unread instructions that will help.
4. I like the fill window as it is Kalashnikov simple. Easy to see how much water is needed and where to stop.
5. I like the carafe concept because it allows me to take the pot with me to the table eliminating trips back and forth if I want and keeps the coffee hot. And yet, herein lies my chief gripe. This carafe was clearly designed by a person who is neither a coffee drinker nor an engineer. The spout assembly is such that you must tip the pot to a near inverted position in order to pour the last 10% of its contents. I cannot stress this enough to the party responsible for the design of this pot: A POT SHOULD EMPTY COMPLETELY WHEN TIPPED 90 DEGREES. I know this most basic technological concept fits neatly within the boundaries of the laws of physics since I've seen it done before.
I take two stars away for this most basic flaw as it reveals itself with EVERY pot of coffee made. We'll see how long I can tolerate it before throwing it away, which I suppose would constitute ""easy to clean"".",John Rutledge,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de diciembre de 2020

Okay . . . not perfect,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this a couple months ago to replace my Coffee Ninja that died after 3 years.

The Cuisinart has a nice look. It is much bigger than I need.

I am the only hot coffee drinker in the house, so I typically make two or three cups at a time. This is probably not where this machine shines. I suspect it is better for full pot brewing.

The stainless pot keeps coffee hot for about 30 minutes and ""warm"" for a couple hours. It would likely stay hot longer if I made a full pot. The design of the pot and its top appears to be intent on keeping the coffee hot. Unfortunately, it makes it difficult to pour a cup of coffee. It only allows for a slow pour and you need to tip the pot way up (90 degreed) to compensate for the shape of the pot. I typically take the top off when I pour, which is a hassle.

The brew cycle takes about 14 minutes, so I typically use the timed brew. Which is fine if you know when you want your coffee.

The machine will not brew unless the pot is perfectly centered. As a result I have returned after 15 minutes to find no coffee. The only way to know it is working is to listen for the steam to start. Annoying when your in a hurry and doesn't help when you use the timed start.

It is otherwise easy to use. Very obvious how to add grounds and water, set clock and timer etc.

It took over a month of use to figure out the proper proportions for the perfect cup.

It seems as though it has fewer parts to fail than the coffee ninja, so hopefully should last longer than 3 years. I may find a better machine by then.

Overall, I am reasonably satisfied with my purchase. Frankly, I would not buy it again.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de agosto de 2021
Something I like some things I don't,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Pros: The coffee taste great, with no grinds getting though to the pot. That is the most important thing in a coffee maker for me! The insulated carafe definitely keeps the coffee warm for hours without getting the burnt coffee taste that you get with most coffee makers.

Cons: It is nearly impossible to pour coffee out of the carafe with out spilling and with out coffee running down the side of the pot. Also because of the shape of the pot you have to almost turn the thing upside down to get the last cup out. The carafe is very heavy and if you have a weak or injured wrist you might have trouble holding it. Last, and this is really important. You can put too much water in this coffee maker!

Stainless Steel Carafe Pot Does Not Pour Well and…,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","… does not keep coffee hot for very long.

The coffee maker is easy to operate & brews coffee well; however, the SS carafe is not well designed bc pouring causes splashing from the lip & makes a mess outside of cup. The coffee flows out from pot, at a very slow rate, bc the way the pot lid is designed there is a small flap controlled opening that is too small. Pouring the last bit of liquid from the pot is a two handed task bc it requires >180 degree turn of wrist & for me is not possible unless I become a contortionist. It requires two hands to finish off the last pour, very annoying.

The carafe keeps coffee hot for approx. 1.5 hrs. & this is in summertime. It will be much less in winter. I get that the carafe is designed to keep coffee hot but it really doesn’t do this very well; in all fairness I only brewed four cups or less & never filled the carafe up. It probably would keep coffee hotter longer in this situation.

In conclusion, the coffee maker works well but the SS carafe does not work well at all.",Diane,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de julio de 2023
"As the kids say, ""Mid""","3,0 de 5 estrellas","I like that the coffee stays warm without a heating element underneath, and the filter system is fine I guess.

The major negative is the carafe itself:
1. The thing cannot easily be cleaned because of the narrow opening. I can get a bottle brush in there, but I'd love to wipe it out with a towel too, and I don't have little tiny baby hands that will fit in the hole.
2. There is a leak between the plastic lip and the metal body allowing water to get inside, and this can cause all sorts of wonderful things to grow inside the air gap. There is a screw at the base of the handle but I don't know if I'll damage the carafe if I start trying to pry it apart to drain and clean it.
3. The thing pours horribly. I take the lid off to pour so I don't have to damn near flip it upside down just to get a cup going in the morning.

"It's okay, but for this price point it should be better","3,0 de 5 estrellas","I enjoy a good cup of coffee every morning. I have Zojirushi Fresh Brew which I love but it was only a 10 cup and with my older daughter now drinking coffee we needed something bigger. I am bias towards thermal carafes. They keep the coffee hot enough without using a hot plate which can turn the coffee bitter (typically I begin my first cup a couple of hours before the other family members do). I chose this Cuisinart because there are not a lot of 12 cup thermal carafe options out there.

Cons:
1) The reviews are true. The second you open this thing it smells like plastic. The kind of plastic smell you get from old screwdriver handles. I read the reviews and bought it anyway because I was willing to clean it. It took one clean cycle using vinegar, two full water cycles and one coffee brewing cycle, but it went away.
2) The carafe is short and fat which is fine aesthetically, but its very hard to get the remaining few ounces out of it (yes, of course I take off the lid). We couldn't use it to fill the tank without making a couple of trips and even then, we couldn't get the last of the water out without going to the sink and turning it completely upside down
3) The overflow hole on the back of the unit is positioned in a place so that if you are not careful, you will pour water through the overflow hole as you are filling up the resivoir.
4) Some other reviewers complained that it is a slow pour. It isn't. They just aren't use to a thermal carafe. If you can't wait the additional 3 seconds, you should reconsider your addiction. However, when pouring coffee, it splatters. you have to keep the spout of the carafe inside your mug because droplets shoot out diagonally and get all over the counter.
5) At this price point, it felt cheap. The carafe is quality, but the machine itself is a very light flimsy plastic.

Pros:
1) Makes a quality tasting coffee
2) Easy to program

Not worth the money,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","As someone who owned and loved an earlier version of the thermal pot coffee maker by Cuisinart, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, six months in and I’ve discovered that this doesn’t compare. While the coffee tastes great and the addition of a water filter is helpful, they are not great enough to outweigh the negatives: 1) The paint on the resting plate chips and rust forms making a mess; 2) the resting plate is hot to the touch after brewing and the thermal carafe does not retain its heat as well as older model; 3) there is a mess to clean off the counter after filling maker with water and after dispensing coffee. Some here have said you need to pour slower. It is true that with some mindfulness you can minimize the splatter, but not eliminate it. On the other hand, do you really want to slowly and mindfully manage your daily coffee? If you pour the ordinary way, you will get a mess. Every. Single. Time. On the plus side, Cuisinart has stood by it’s product and is sending me a replacement. I asked if I could get a discount on a different one as this one is a dud on many levels, but no, warranty covers only replacement. Think twice and buy once — and not this one.

Edit: Added another star because I was able to exchange this for a replacement through Cuisinart with truly no hassle at all. Also, the new carafe does NOT sputter and splash it’s contents when pouring! So there must be some variation in production lots that account for the splash factor. Hopefully the rust issue is lot specific as well! Time will tell.

Second Update: second coffee maker is now rusted and dripping as well (gasket??). I’m not going to bother exchanging this one. I will just buy a non-Cuisinart next time.",Ellen,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de abril de 2021

Because of my love of the Cuisinart brand of coffeemakers, and because this one has driven me up a wall, I reached out to customer service for possibly a coupon of some sort to take some of the cost off a new (Cuisinart-different model).

Coffee Tasted Good; Slightly Awkward to Fill Water; Lost Heat Slightly Faster than Older Model,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","We returned this. It looks very nice, the timer functions fine, the coffee tastes good. One slightly annoying design aspect is the water reservoir. There are two smaller areas into which you can pour the water to fill the reservoir, and there is a piece of the main system between these two areas. If you happen to pour water atop this piece of the main system, the water will run into the grounds basket.

The real reason we are returning this, is that we measured heat loss from the carafe using food thermometers and checking at a few intervals and found the newer model seems to lose heat slightly faster than the 14 year old Cuisinart model we have kept until now and want to replace. We measured the water temp after pouring into a cup immediately after filling a full carafe. The temp was 160 F in both this new model as well as in a Cuisinart thermal carafe coffee maker purchased circa 2007.

After 70 minutes both still measured 160 after pouring a cup.

After 130 minutes, both measured 150.

After 240 minutes, the new coffee maker new was 130 but the 2007-vintage model was 135.

After 300 minutes, the new was 114 and old was 118.

After about 12 hours, new was 67 and old was 80.

I GUESS the reason for very slightly higher rate of heat loss in the newer model has something to do with the newer models more slimly designed carafe lid. The older model has a beefy lid with a complicated system of valves. The new model has a much thinner lid that lacks that kind of valve system.

The newer model also seems to splatter some coffee to the side just slightly when it pours.

This is NOT a bad coffee maker. It's good. But we happened to be looking for more of an upgrade.",Lukpla,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de febrero de 2021
"SO loud, dangerous and messy","3,0 de 5 estrellas","We have an older version of this in our RV. It is hard to fill like this one, but quiet and works well. This new one is awful and scary. It is so loud with a popping noise when it brews, it woke me upon a panic the first morning at 3:30am.

The machine is super messy. It’s impossible to get the water filled without spilling as the input area is small and next to the lid. You already forced to use a separate container, not the carafe to do this.

After it’s done brewing, the entire unit is wet. The top of the coffee carafe, the inside of the brew area, the back of the unit where steam comes out, etc. I have been wiping the entire thing and my counter off every day.

Additionally, it’s dangerous! Don’t open it within 5 min of it being brewed. I almost burnt my face off the first day when I went to take the grounds basket out to dump it. It blows a HUGE amount of steam out when you open the lid.

Lastly, it heats the coffee to 170 degrees. While this is nice to keep coffee hot all day, my husband burned his mouth the first day, not knowing it would be this way.

Save your money. Not worth it. Going back to Amazon.

*Update, just over a year from buying. We kept this thing, and the bottom plate where the carafe sits got rusty. I have no idea why! Two strikes, I won’t be buying again. 🙄🤦‍♀️",Kim V,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de septiembre de 2021
It has its good and bad qualities,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I read many of the reviews before deciding to purchase this coffeemaker. I decided to take a chance on it despite some concerning comments since most of the reviews were positive. What I discovered through personal experience after about a week of use is that what makes it good is also what makes it bad.

The carafe's design allows the coffee to stay hot for a longer period of time. But because of the way it is designed, it can't be used to measure how much water is being poured into the coffeemaker. Before, with my previous coffeemaker, I was able to use my glass carafe to do so. Now, I have to use a measuring cup instead.

In addition, the design of this carafe makes it very difficult to clean. The opening on top is too small for adult hands to reach inside to clean. So other methods are needed to do so.

Finally, in order to pour all the coffee out of the carafe, it has to nearly be upside down above the cup. This is due to a design that is meant to keep the coffee hot and for longer.

With all this being said, the coffee made from this machine tastes really good. So, it's a trade off. Is there a way that a coffee maker can keep coffee hot and tasty without the drawbacks I just mentioned at around the same price I paid for this machine? I don't know, but that is why this coffeemaker gets three stars from me. Buyer beware!",TT,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de noviembre de 2021
Works good but we hate it,"3,0 de 5 estrellas",The coffee maker works well and the coffee is good but the carafe is not designed well. You have to turn it completely upside down to get the last of the coffee out and it splashes and spills everywhere. The carafe is hard to clean. The hole in the top is not big enough to get your hand in and even with turning it upside down all the liquid does not come out so you have to use a bottle brush or something to dry out the inside. For these reasons we hate it but we tossed the box so we can’t send it back for a refund.,Kim,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de enero de 2024
Good coffee; annoying design,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","There aren't many thermal carafe makers out there so I was happy to discover this one. So close to a great machine, but not quite.

PLUSES
- Carafe keeps coffee hot for several hours
- 12-cup capacity is nicely larger than the typical 10-cup (since ""2 cups"" in the machine equals about one 12 oz. mug) so one pot more likely to caffeinates 2 people using mugs ;-)
- Relatively compact footprint for capacity
- Lid over coffee filter and water reservoir opens up a full 90 degree lending greater access
- Not over complicated; does just enough without introduce excess opportunities for failure

MINUSES
- You have to turn the carafe nearly upside down (180 degrees) in order the empty it. Good thing I don't have arthritis...yet
- The carafe lid does not move/pop open to pour coffee with a good flow. Instead, it releases coffee in a very fine, slow, stream which creates three problems:
a) spatters coffee around the cup (so don't pour over placements or a table cloth!)
b) takes forever to pour (especially if you're trying to avoid spatter
c) fine, low-volume stream doesn't sound like you're pouring a generous cup of great coffee. I'm reminded of other fine stream, water-like sounds that kills my happy breakfast mood
- Using the carafe to pour water into reservoir is cumbersome. Given the small corner space of the reservoir itself, added to the carafe design, it's easy to pour water into the coffee filter basket accidentally rather than just into the corner reservoir.
- Stainless steel sides show fingerprints readily. Given I have to touch/move the device from underneath my cabinets each day in order to open the lid to add coffee grinds and water, it always looks bad unless I clean each time I use it

There is nothing damaged or broken about the device so I can't return it but these design flaws are set to annoy me for years to come. Maybe I should try more decaf...",Elizabeth,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de agosto de 2020
"Overflows, Unless You Know the Secret","3,0 de 5 estrellas","We spent six months trying to solve the problem of overflows when brewing 12 cups of coffee in this machine. We first changed filter types; we then tried a coarser grind; we even tried brewing less than 12 cups at a time, meanwhile keeping the unit fastidiously clean. Nothing solved the problem. Then, recently, I happened to notice that the position of the carafe on the base plate made a huge difference in how much the drain valve at the bottom of the coffee grounds cup opened. When pushed to the rear, the valve was nearly closed, whereas when pulled forward just a little, the valve opened completely, allowing the water to rum through the grounds at the required rate. This is totally a defect in design and should be corrected by the company.",Penny,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de agosto de 2023
Good Coffee but Cumbersome,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Cuisinart, the name is respected for its quality, durability and dependability. Our first one lasted 18 yeas and was always a great brew. This new one brews coffee as well as you would expect of Cuisinart. That gets 5 stars. It is sturdy and good to see on your counter, another 5 stars. However, the new design has pushed me to the edge of giving it away. The carafe's new shape makes it impossible to empty without twisting your wrist into an unnatural position. This new shape combined with the new tower also causes problems. When filling the tower, the water hits a more bulky post in the middle so it splashes out. In order to avoid that, you must pour slowly. Also, to get all the water out of the carafe, it must be turned completely upside down and the water maneuvered to the spout–if you don't want ""unbrewed"" water remaining in it. Turning it completely upside down would be fine IF the new wider, stout carafe was able to fit without having to push the tower's lid beyond its limit. It is so wide that the spout misses the tower unless you either push the cover beyond its limit OR settle for some water to remain in the carafe. I am expecting the lid to eventually break off because of that. I thought I would be able to adjust to a new way of filling the tower, so I didn't return it. I should have returned it. My wife is fine with the residual water left in the carafe, but her wrist can't handle the necessary twist - she has to use both hands, pour slowly (so as not to splash onto the counter) and wiggle it around when it is completely upside down to get the water out. So…she doesn't use it. I make the coffee, but now it is served with chagrin. It used to be a pleasant experience.",PT Reedley,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de julio de 2019

not as good as Mr Coffee,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Purchased this unit to replace our Mr. Coffee Optimal maker, I miss my Mr. Coffee.

The Cuisinart's water tank is built into the unit. To fill the water tank you must fill a different container, lift the water above the coffee maker, and carefully pour the water into small dark slots behind the filter assembly. The black plastic makes it hard to see how full the tank is, you must watch an fill indicator on the side while keeping the water aimed into the slots. It has gotten messy a number of times. --- The Mr. Coffee's water tank can be easily removed from the unit for filling. The tank stands in the sink a fills directly from the tap. The full tank is easy to lift and set back into unit.

The Cuisinart's filter is cone shaped and the filter assembly will not sit upright on the counter. The coffee filter shape requires the assembly is in the unit while scooping coffee grinds into it. It can be messy and it is not easy to clean stray coffee grinds from inside the unit. --- The Mr. Coffee uses a flat filter which sit upright on the counter. It's much easier to wipe the counter then the inside of the Cuisinart.

The Cuisinart thermal carafe has a lip inside that requires the carafe to be turned upside down to be completely emptied. This makes cleaning the carafe and filling the water tank from the carafe very difficult, it is easier use a different container. --- The Mr. Coffee does not have this issue.

horrible carafe,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I've had nothing but cheap Mr. Coffee type brands prior to this purchase, and been fine. My last one's heating element died after 8 years of use. My fiance insisted we get a ""good"" brand this time & with the thermal carafe because he insists on his coffee causing burns inside his mouth. I hated to do it but I purchased this for $130 or something like that, and guess what, I hate it. Every poster is correct when saying the carafe is sooo poorly designed. Its very heavy even when empty, it pours incredibly slowly into your cup, and you can never get the last 1/4 cup out because of how the inside is designed. Also, you need to pull out your long handled scrub brush to clean inside, because not even a child's hand would fit thru the opening. The ""tone"" to alert you that brewing has finished awakens you as if the smoke alarm is going off (totally freaked us out the first few times, and still is very concerning). The carafe based on comments, did not keep the coffee as hot for as long as expected. 2 hours max and then you're using the microwave anyway. The gold tone filter allows ground coffee to leave a lot of residue floating thru, so you get thick coffee sludge in the last of your coffee cup. Its a total disappointment for so much expense, and I waited too long so now I can't return it. I may actually have to give up coffee because of this stupid thing. The only ""pro"" about this is the fact that your coffee doesn't taste cooked after 2 hours.",Faith Love,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de octubre de 2020
The taste just wasn't as good as it should be.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I really wanted to like this coffee maker. I love the idea of an insulated pot (be aware that this one is quite heavy though) where the coffee stays hot without burning. I would say that the unit functions well and I like the features except for pouring the water it. The other reviewers were correct that it is a bit of a pain to pour into the fairly small water area, and I had to use a separate container to add the water, not the pot, which you do almost have to tip upside down to get the coffee out. The issue that made me return this maker was the TASTE. It was only OK - maybe even a bit acidic - and it is not my coffee or water quality. My old Ninja made a tasty brew with the very same coffee and water type, but it had a leak problem too early in its life, so I thought I would try this one. Perhaps the water runs through this maker too hot, but it was not tasty to us. Reluctantly, I'm back to Ninja. Sorry Cuisinart.",Jennifer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de octubre de 2022

It creates a chaotic stream that inevitably drips all over. I've only owned it for about 20 months but my wife can't take it anymore and were looking to replace it with something.

"Things I Like (Styling, Size, Brewing Quality), Things I Don't (Filling, Carafe Design, Overflows)","3,0 de 5 estrellas","Pros:
1) The styling is nice overall, though (like anything these days), a lot of plastic.
2) The footprint is good -- it fits under our counter nicely.
3) I like the coffee it brews; not sure if it's the cone filter or something else, but the coffee is better than the last basket-style coffee maker we had.
4) The controls are reasonably minimal and I like the display.
5) I like having a larger 12 (5 oz) cup maker than our old 10 (5 oz) cup.
6) I am a big fan of thermal carafes, so I love that part as well.

Cons:
1) Filling the brewer is a pain, partly because there's not much area to pour into and you have to aim well, and partly because of the carafe design (coming up next).
2) The carafe needs some work. It is almost possible to use it to fill the coffee maker because you have to tip it so far over to get the last third of water into the pot, and the same applies for getting coffee into your cup. You can't really get the last bit of coffee out. Further, the spout is a disaster: it sprays coffee out the sides so you have to put the spout almost into your coffee cup.
3) If you're not careful putting the coffee pot back into the maker after sneaking a cup prior to brewing being finished MAKE SURE YOU DIDN'T POP THE BASKET UP A BIT or it will overflow all over your counter.

Overall, I'm moderately happy with the coffee pot, but a little surprised at it's price point that some of the design issues haven't been ironed out. (I mean, does anything try these things before they ship?)",The Dabbler,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de febrero de 2019

"Terrible, terrible carafe","3,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a great coffee maker for making coffee. It's honestly some of the best home brewed coffee I've had.

It's horrible for serving that coffee. The carafe is a nightmare to use. Unless it's more than half full, you have to tilt it more than 90 degrees forward to get the coffee to pour. The further you tilt it, the more the coffee begins to splatter. If you use it to brew 2-4 cups, which is what we use five days a week, you have to turn it almost upside down to get coffee out. At first I though the carafe was broken until I really looked at the lid and figured out how it worked. Coffee has to reach almost the center of the lid to make it to the opening the feeds the spout.

Except for the one, but significant defect, this makes delicious coffee and I'll keep using it even though it frustrates me every time I pour a cup.",David L. Reynolds,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de abril de 2023
"Overall Good, but poor design features","3,0 de 5 estrellas","The coffee that I get from this is good, it's attractive-looking, and I appreciate that it comes with a reusable filter. My biggest complaint is that the pot does not pour well. It's big and clunky and you have to tip it way farther than it seems you should to get coffee. I drink maybe half or 1/3 pot and like that there is a setting for this. However, with that amount of coffee in the pot, it is even harder to pour. I literally have to turn the whole pot completely upside down and then it gets messy, starts coming out the sides of the top. Same with putting water into the maker. It's in a corner on my counter - the only place that fits it (it's a pretty big machine) but then because I have to tip the whole pot to get water in, it hits the wall - so I have to pull it away or find some other container for pouring. Lastly, the beep that tells you it is down is startlingly loud! Since it brews slowly, it is nice to know when it's done, but you can only have it off or blaring, with no way to just calm the noise down. None of these are huge, but to be honest, if I'm going to pay this much for a coffee maker, I expected more nuanced design features.

Makes ok coffee....but carafe is HEAVY and drips (and be especially aware if you have tennis elbow!),"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I don't notice any difference in terms of the quality of the brew compared to my previous coffee maker (a $20 one!), so no issues there. It also keeps the coffee warn for hours, so that is a plus for sure. I have had a cup 4 or 5 hours after brewing and it still tasted great.

What I do not like about this coffee maker is that the carafe is just so heavy - even with nothing in it. I have on/off bouts with tennis elbow and on some days can hardly pick the thing up! It is also VERY hard to empty all the liquid out of it so I now have to use a separate water jug to load water in the machine which just int's very efficient (on my old one, I would fill the carafe with water after I cleaned it and then pour directly into the machine - now I have to clean the carafe, empty it, and fill a separate vessel with water and then dry that off).

The other thing I do not like about this coffee maker is the fact that it drips and ""splashes"" EVERY time I pour from the carafe to a cup. It doesn't matter how tight the lid is - it ALWAYS leaks. I have to clean the counter repeatedly to get rid of all the drips and ""splashes"".

Bottom line, it makes a good pot of coffee that will taste fresh for hours, but it's very heavy and if you have any sort of elbow issues, pouring a cup of coffee is not only messy but painful!",The Mordys,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de mayo de 2020
"Coffee good, caraffe bad","3,0 de 5 estrellas","We have no problem with the coffee. However, the caraffe is heavy, when full. The handle is awkward to pour.

When filling with water, it is nearly impossible to keep some water from spilling over into the coffee grounds and over the side and dripping onto the base. To prevent this, the caraffe has to be in place before filling. Finally, the interrupt to serve function does not work well. The instructions say to limit this to less than 20 Seconds. The coffee spills over the top of the basket quicker than that.

It's impossible to get your hand in the carafe to adequately wash it.

It is also inconsistent in the final amount of coffee. I put the same amount of water and coffee grounds and some days I can fill 2 16 ounce travel mugs, other days they're only 3/4 full. It's a little frustrating.",Kathy Arend,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de agosto de 2023
Difficult to fill with water,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee maker is much better than the Keurig Duo Plus I previously had for a few months. It would fail every week if you didn't run vinegar through it. This unit work well and I don't have to clean it weekly. I like the bell sound it makes when done because I am normally not in the same room as the coffee maker.

My biggest complaint is the design of the carafe and the procedure for filling the coffee maker with water. The carafe is poorly designed with a huge flat top, where the opening is about half the size of the overall top. That means you have to have the carafe completely upside down to get most of the water out of it. This makes filling the unit a real pain because the spot to fill is a weird small shape at the back and the cover only hinges to 90 degrees, so you will spill a bunch of water when filling.

This is just poorly designed. Make a carafe more like the Keurig Duo Plus (which is the only thing I liked about that unit) and let the top cover open up more or else make the openings for pouring bigger.

Carafe design could be a lot better,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","My last coffeemakers have all had glass carafe-with-heat-plate designs. For some time I've thought about getting one with a thermal carafe, though, and chose this one when my last coffeemaker died. Setup is easy. I don't use the time brew feature so I don't know how well it works. Downside: Though the carafe keeps coffee hot for a long time, it is poorly designed.

It didn't take me but one pot to find I have to add nearly another cup if I wanted my usual 2-3 mugs because of the difficulty in emptying the carafe. The only way to get that last bit out is to hold it upside down. Literally. No way to pour it into a mug. I end up dumping a half cup or so down the sink each time. Not a big deal if you can afford the waste, but...

And the lid opening is too small to permit easy cleaning. Too small for my hand, anyway. So far I rinse it with clean water, then drop a cloth or paper towel inside and use the handle of one of my spatulas or spoons to push it around.

So why do I keep it? Though these issues are annoying they do not outweigh the convenience of having hot coffee throughout the day in a carafe that can be set on any surface (the outside of the carafe never gets hot).

Initial (and more recent) impressions of the DCC-3400,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","The DCC-3400 is Cuisinart's newest model and, I guess, their effort to improve on the DCC-3200, which recently was CR's highest rated coffee maker. I've had my 3400 for a week and here are my initial observations:

First, it makes good coffee but larger quantities seem to taste better. My wife likes two nominal cups of full-strength in the a.m. whereas I'm a decaf guy so I've been making two separate batches of 2-3 cups. That coffee tastes fine but this a.m. I made 5 cups of brew and it definitely had a fuller aroma.

Second, the insulated carafe (no more glass pot and hot plate) is a monster. It keeps the coffee drinkably hot for several hours but it weighs 2 lbs. 4 oz. empty. It's impossible to tell by hefting it how much coffee is left. As other reviewers have noted, it's also almost impossible to pour out the last couple ounces from the carafe without removing the lid.

Third, this machine is tall, 21 3/4 in. with the top open. We have a ""coffee station"" in a kitchen cabinet and I had to raise the overhead shelf several notches to get sufficient clearance.

Overall, I'm glad I bought this coffee maker but it's not perfect. I evaluated a bunch of machines and believe this is the best available at the ~$100 price point.

August 5, 2017 update. Trying to get the last couple ounces out of the poorly designed carafe is a recurring pain in the posterior although the coffee does taste fresher longer than an open-top carafe.

Oddly, we don't find this a deal breaker, but it sure would be nice for something as simple as a digital clock would keep time. We do like to set the program and it typically goes off early.

Incredibly awkward design,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","So that I can be a little positive and end on a high note, I'll start with the negatives:

Cons
- The coffeemaker is much taller than others I've owned, which makes it tricky to pour in the water.
- Speaking of, my biggest complaint is that the coffee pot itself has a lip around the top that makes it almost impossible to get out the last 1/2 cup of coffee (or water if you're using it to fill up the water carafe). In the beginning, I was holding it literally upside-down to pour in the water, which would inevitably wind up getting everywhere. Now, I have a separate water pitcher that I use to fill up the carafe. It's really annoying.
- It takes an unusually long amount of time to brew a pot, and it's super noisy

Pros
- I like the bold setting so I can make the coffee richer
- The coffee pot being stainless steel does seem to keep the coffee warmer longer
- I haven't used the delay brewing function yet, but that's a nice perk
- I like that it has the brew pause feature where I can pull out the coffee pot to fill my cup while it's brewing

I don't dislike it enough to send it back, but I wish I'd read more reviews before I bought it. Buyer beware.",Kellie L.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de enero de 2021

Poorly Designed Carafe,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Pros:
- It makes coffee
- The coffee does stay hot much longer than other insulated Carafes I have used.

Con: The design of the Carafe is embarrassingly bad.

- Because the pour/spout is blocked by a wide plastic ring (WHY!!!!!???!!!) the last 1/2 - 3/4 cups of coffee cannot be poured into a cup - you essentially have to put your cup in the sink, hold the carafe upside down and hope some if it makes it in.

- It is bulky and the water reservoir is narrow and the carafe has the above issue, it it very difficult to use the carafe to fill the coffeemaker without a wet counter. Since you (essentially) cannot get all the water out of the carafe you will water down your coffee a bit.

- It is almost impossible to clean (because of the above problem)

It sounds like a little issue but when you have to deal with it every day and you are wiping down your counter instead of drinking your AM coffee...",smp,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de marzo de 2022
Not 3x better for 3x the cost,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I used to have a $25 coffee maker, the coffee tasted fine, but the pot would drip all over the counter every time I poured it, and the heat plate would burn the coffee left in the pot making for a not-so-great cup of coffee at noon.

So Big Meech over here decided it was time to invest some money into a coffee maker befitting an adult. No more bottom shelf, coffee burning, dripping pot coffee maker for me. If I want something good I’m going to have to fork out the big bucks for that big insulted pot and high quality build with no heating element.

Huge spoiler alert here. This pot still drips on the counter when I pour. There’s no heating element so it doesn’t burn the coffee, but the pot doesn’t keep it warm longer than an hour so by noon, anything left in the pot is ice cold.

However, I miss the glass carafe and warming plate that my older model had. The new model sports a metal ""thermal"" carafe that more or less keeps coffee hot enough for awhile. It comes out at about 185º. Nice! But it doesn't stay that way, especially if you're brewing only four or five cups instead of 12. Whereas the glass carafe models keep the coffee constantly warm, this one brews the coffee and then cheerfully goes to sleep. A separate hot plate--or the microwave helps but that's a pain. Also, as several people have mentioned, you have to turn the metal thermal carafe nearly upside down to pour out the last cup or two. Clumsy engineering from Cuisinart!

"Don't fall for the hype - Luke warm coffee, Loud brew, slow pour","3,0 de 5 estrellas","Flavor: Biggest issue with flavor is the temperature. It's not hot enough. Rest of flavor is determined by water, beans, and grind. What this unit can control, it does adequate at, but coffee temp is about the same as you'd get a busy diner that's short staffed.

Easy to clean: only the carafe and basket are removeable. Lid on carafe is a bit small for large hands, but the biggest issue is cleaning under the upper rim which is difficult to reach thoroughly.

Easy to use: This is my biggest complaint. The carafe has to be almost upside down to pour. Then the pour feels like it is very restricted and takes way to long to pour a single cup. When brewing, the machine is very loud and sounds like the pump is failing also takes about 10 minutes to brew a 12 cup pot.

Pot designed poorly.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Humans have been brewing coffee for hundreds of years. I would have thought by now that engineers could design a coffee pot that allows you to pour it's entire contents without spilling.

This is not that pot. You can pour most of the pot of coffee with reasonable ease, but if you want that last inch of delicious coffee, you're going to have to work for it with this pot. No amount of adjustments to the angle of pour will produce that last inch of coffee. And you will spill and dribble a fair amount of it, before you finally cave, and unscrew the lid entirely. You might think you've outsmarted the pot, but you're wrong. You will finally get the last of the coffee, but some of that last bit will wind up on your counter, or dribbling down the side of your cup.

"Great coffee, needs a better pouring system","3,0 de 5 estrellas","I have previously had the ubiquitous Cuisinart 12-cup coffee maker and loved it for more than 20 years. When it finally died I decided to try the thermos carafe version because I hate cooked coffee. The only downside of the old Cuisinart coffee maker had been that pouring dribbled more than I would like and filling the coffee maker with water was awkward. Well dear reader, the thermos carafe version is much worse. Filling the coffee maker is cumbersome and requires lots of clear space around the coffee maker. You also have to nearly invert the carafe to get all of the water out. Needless to say water gets everywhere typically wetting the filter and grounds. I would love to see a demonstration video by the designer explaining why this is not totally unacceptable. Pouring coffee with the thermal carafe is also frustrating, the air lock built in to the lid prevents pouring a complete cup and you repeatedly have to right the carafe to allow air in. With sufficient vacuum from a long pour it will also suck in air which will suddenly and unpredictably increase the flow rate. Hurray.

Cuisinart has made the best consumer coffee maker for a long time by focusing on design and quality. Apparently they no longer care about making a great coffee maker. This thermos model is really disappointing and I will be annoyed with Cuisinart for designing it so badly every morning for many years to come.",Mike Duigou,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de abril de 2020

I was looking at a lot of models and this one was on the pricey end for me but I thought justified because I love coffee and it’s a good brand name, but super disappointed in it.

First, when you pour coffee it dribbles and always leaves drops of coffee on the counter. I always have to wipe up after this thing. And I can't believe someone can't figure out how to design one that doesn't do that. Second, pouring water into this coffee maker is a pain. It always spills because the opening where the coffee goes in is small and the carafe is clumsily designed to match up with said opening. Once again water is spilling. Why do I have to use a special plastic container to make up for this poor design?

Things I do not like about this new unit are it's size. Takes up more counter space. The water reservoir is much harder to fill as the pour opening is in the rear and is much smaller. The coffee grounds basket fits deep inside the unit and is more difficult to fill and remove. Makes great coffer but just not as user friendly.

Good coffee but would not buy a thermal carafe again,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","When my last coffee maker died recently I was in the market for a new one and settled on this Cuisinart model after a lot of research. The machine itself is easy to operate and makes a pretty good cup of coffee. What I wish I had done differently was order the glass carafe rather than the metal thermal carafe. This model coffee maker offers both options. When considering the carafes I decided on the thermal one because the glass carafes can break and the heating plate does ""cook"" the coffee while keeping it hot which ruins it if it isn't poured relatively quickly. I also have had every coffee makers heating plate eventually rust not matter how carefully I maintain it. I thought the thermal carafe was a better option and would keep the coffee hot and tasting like it was freshly brewed. The coffee stays hot but the flavor does change if left for a while. But what really bothers me is the carafe itself. It is extremely heavy and when coffee is poured it tends to splatter everywhere. The carafe is constructed in a way that does not allow you to pour all of the coffee out and the opening at the top is too small to clean it easily. There is no way for any adult to put their hand into it and scrubbing with a brush is not very effective. Like a thermal travel mug residue and tannins builds up inside the carafe affecting the flavor. I have only had my coffee maker a couple of months and the inside of the carafe is already stained. I haven't yet figured out how to clean it correctly.",Susan M. Reagan,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de septiembre de 2021
"Makes very good coffee, carafe is a disaster.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this to replace my Moccamaster coffee maker that died after 10 years. While I loved that coffee maker I just wasn't ready to spend another $300+ on a coffee maker again, although I was glad I did. After 10 years, that coffee maker made, easily, 10's of thousands of pots of coffee. This Cuisinart however, does make excellent coffee. And that's really the measure of a coffee maker when it comes right down to it. I like the ""Bold"" option as I like my coffee strong and the ""1-4"" option is also handy when making small pots and seems to work to make those small pots taste as good as a large one. I can't speak to the Programming Function as I never, ever use it.
The biggest drawback, as many reviews here and other places state is the carafe design. It is just abysmal. It's fine for the first half of the pot but after that, it just borders on ridiculous. And yes, you literally have to turn the entire thing upside down to empty the last of the coffee out of carafe. If it weren't for that, this would easily be a 5-star review. It definitely makes 5-star coffee. And forget about filling the coffee maker with fresh water using carafe. I only made that mistake the first day. Now I have my trusty re-usable water bottle nearby which does double duty as both a water bottle and coffee maker filler. Problem solved.
The carafe does, however, keep the coffee very warm. It is hot-hot for at least 3 hours and very warm for 5 or 6. In that regard, it's wonderful. If it weren't for the usability issue, it would be a perfect 10.
All in all, a great purchase and well worth the money. I would buy it again provided it lasts for a few years before dying. Since I just purchased it, that remains to be seen, but early impressions are good and I've had good luck with Cuisinart products in the past.",Brian Vallet,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de julio de 2020
"Some usability flaws, but makes great coffee","4,0 de 5 estrellas","This 12-cup thermal carafe replaced a similar, but no longer produced, model by the same manufacturer. I hate the burned taste of coffee that has been sitting on a hot-plate, and we needed as big a carafe as possible, so this was one of few options.

Pros:
- Makes great tasting coffee.
- Squat form factor fits under cabinets better.
- Buttons easier to use than the old ones.
- ""Coffee's done"" beeper can be turned off
- Decent looking
- Easier to see how much water is in reservoir than old floating ""ball in tube"" style.

Cons:
- Pour spout is garbage at its only job. Slow pour and difficult to pour coffee without splattering all over the counter. Every morning another paper towel parked in front of the unit.
- Awkward to fill water reservoir. Small pouring target, and if you miss it goes into the basket area either splashing the grounds or making a mess on the counter.
- Constant blue-glowing LCD looks tacky.
- These Cuisinart models only last about 4 years in daily use. The thermal shut-off attached to the heating tube has failed on the two previous units we've had and are very difficult to source and replace. I expect this one to break in August, 2026...let's see if this prediction comes true.

Thermal carafe shines,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I think every coffee maker review should start with how you control flavor and quality independent of the maker.

I buy whole bean that is ideally just a week or two from roast date. I use filtered water and grind the whole beans immediately before placing them into the coffee maker.

I could not taste a discernable difference between this and my old 20 dollar black & decker. Granted I've only made two full pots so it might turn out to produce better on average.

But I didn't expect it to do any better: I think anyone who sticks to drip coffee understands that process has more to do with it. Don't grind your beans and let them sit overnight if you want the best taste. Use filtered water and clean/descale your damn coffee maker every once in a while.

That being said, the thermal carafe here does a phenomenal job.

I just poured myself a cup from a pot that was made 8.5 hours ago. It was still above my ideal drinking temperature without any heating element.

Great Coffee Maker & Great Warranty Support from Company,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is my second Cuisinart Coffee Maker. My first lasted about a good 8 years...but time wears on things.
So I purchased this new, upgraded, unit back in March 2020 to replace my older one (which I gave to a friend). One perk was that all those filters I had purchased in a max pack fit this unit perfectly.
But, about 6 weeks ago it started acting up. The water would not go into the drip container, it would instead flow back into the water tank and then leak all over. Major bummer. Never had issues with last one.
However, I checked the PDF on warranty info, which is listed here on product page, and sure enough Cuisinart has a 3 year warranty. I contacted their 800 number, gave them the model #, serial number and explained the issue and VOILA! They are sending me a replacement.
Of course I had to do a couple things, like cut the cord on the device and send them proof of that via email. But, sending/shipping back the unit was NOT part of it. THAT right there makes a huge difference.
When they work, they do so beautifully and last well.
When you might, or do, have an issue with them, they take care of their customers with minimum fuss and without making them jump through hoops.

"Good Coffee Maker, Better Alternatives","4,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee maker has some really nice features. The stainless steel carafe keeps the coffee warm for a long time so I don't have to worry about turning to burner off and on again to heat it up or microwave a late morning 2nd cup to get it warm. It has a bold brew feature that seems to give the brew some extra smooth flavor. Maybe best of all, it has a scheduler so you can load it up the night before and set it to run so you can wake up to the smell of coffee.

Now what I don't like about it. My biggest issue so far is that it drips coffee on the burner when you first take out the pot to pour. With a little jiggling it can be mitigated some, but it can still be very annoying to keep a paper towel to clean that up every time you pour your coffee. Second, when the pot is getting low, you have to pretty much turn it completely upside down to get the last of the coffee out because it comes out through the lid into the spout. Not a huge deal but it can feel a little ridiculous when you're emptying it out. On the plus side this method keeps a nice even pour for your cup so I can see the benefit.

All and all it's a good coffee maker, but I wish I had gone with the cheaper KRUPS ET351 that had all these positives but none of the negatives.",Chris,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de junio de 2021
Coffee brews quickly and stays warm in the carafe for a long time.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",This version is so much better than our older Quisinart 10 cup coffee maker. 12 cups brew more quickly and the coffee stays very warm in the carafe for an extended period. A couple downfalls: fingerprints really show on the stainless steel surface and the clock will not keep accurate time. We have to adjust the time every couple weeks.,"Midwest AeroWorks, LLC",Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de noviembre de 2023
"Form Follows Function, but there's room for both!","4,0 de 5 estrellas","The Cuisinart DCC-3400P1 coffee maker has the basics of what I need in a drip brewer. Clean lines, attractive black & stainless design, 12-cup capacity, portable carafe that keeps coffee hot and doesn't break on stone surfaces. However, the design has two downsides (or flaws) that should be considered before purchasing. The first you'll notice is that the reservoir is clumsy to access. You have to lift the lid (which only flips back to a 45 degree angle). This means it doesn't fit under most above-counter cabinets while filling. Next, the narrow reservoir opening is in the back which makes it difficult to use the large carafe to fill it. It bumps up against the reservoir lid. The carafe is sturdy and keeps the brew hot, but the small opening in the pot makes it difficult to clean and restricts the pour. I consistently have about a cup of coffee at the bottom of the pot because you have to turn the thing upside down to get all the liquid out. It's wasteful at best. The reservoir lid should be removable for better access and the opening in the pot should be a tad larger for cleaning and pouring ease.

We've had this brewer for only about a week now. The first one was delivered damaged, but the replacement was easy and quick. So far, we like the coffee's taste, the length of time it stays hot, and the sturdy pot. We use a narrow-topped pitcher to fill the reservoir and bought a long-handled brush to clean the pot. We're making it work, but honestly, it's a little annoying.

UPDATE: Beware. This brewer puts off a lot of steam! I found the bottom of my above-counter cabinet was soaking wet after a brew. The steam also moistened the spices in the cabinet. I now keep the brewer on a placemat to slide it out from under the cabinet when it’s brewing.",Jack,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de marzo de 2020
"5 Star Coffee, Hoping for Better Than My Experienced Brand Average Reliability","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I'd love it if the display were bigger. I can't read time from across the room.

The good:
Great coffee.
Like all similar designs (12-cup thermal carafe), this one has the flap in the lid to seal in flavor. Some users report that the flap can dry in the wrong position, causing coffee to spill onto counter while brewing). I avoid those spill problems with lid by rinsing it out daily & then shaking it to remove as much water as I can, afterwards. Takes 30 seconds.
Fewer mechanical parts in lid to break (compared to similar Cuisinart models). Hoping this one lasts longer than the 1-year average from all prior similar Cuisinart models (about 6 in various similar designs for 12-cup thermal carafe). Cuisinart model it replaces had the larger display I prefer, but it has a spring loaded lid whose mechanism & hinge broke in just under a year. Range of similar Cuisinart pots has ranged from 1 month to 3 years, depending on how faithfully I'm able to remember to run white vinegar through it to remove calcification from our moderately hard water.
Locating the electronics above the pot prevents spills (especially if spill results from lid being sealed shut while brewing coffee)

The Not-as-good
Time can't be read from more than a few feet away. I prefer a larger display I can read from the breakfast table across the room.
End-of-cycle alarm is scary-loud. The bar above the display is it's on/off toggle. It's very easy to turn it back on when doing anything else with the controls.
My experience of brand reliability has ranged from 1-star to 4 star, average 3-star.
Not sure how they count 12 cups in this pot, as I get only 4 cups out of it (cup holds 18 ounces when filled to rim). If 8-oz cups, there are 9.

After 6 tries, why do I keep buying Cuisinart? They're the only maker of a 5-star coffee maker I've found who has a thermal carafe even this large.",Bill S.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de enero de 2018
You had one job....,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I received my coffee maker yesterday afternoon and prepped it to make coffee in the morning, sadly after pouring my 1st cup and even more sadly my second cup it left giant puddles on the counter top. Not even sure why as you can't tell where it is coming from or that it is even happening until you stop pouring it. The main reason I got a new one is because yesterday morning my old coffee pot while brewing went all over the place, while this one didn't do that to me the end result is the same a mess of coffee to clean up. For this price it should not be doing this on the first day or even the 365th day. BIG disappointment. If the situation changes I'll update this review.

UPDATE: I do not remember who it was but someone posted to treat the seals around the lid with vegetable oil and that it had fixed their leaking issue. I figured what do I have to lose, well it worked and no more puddles on the counter.",Pokeypup,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de mayo de 2022
"Great coffee, easy to use, stays hot.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","We just got this coffee maker, and we are quite happy with it. Clear instructions, easy to use (including a simple way to turn off the alarm!), the coffee tastes good, and the carafe keeps it hot. Before buying, we did read a few negative comments, but they are all easily overcome:
1 - Cleaning the carafe - use a brush, it works fine
2 - Coffee gets cold too fast - Heat the carafe (wash out with hot water) before you put coffee in it - See the second law of thermodynamics if you don't understand!
3 - The screen is too bright at night (Seriously?????) - If you are really that sensitive, get a post-it note",Ottawa,Revisado en Canadá el 10 de enero de 2023
Solid Choice,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought a refurbished version from the Amazon warehouse and saved $60 off the $129 list price - The only thing that I appeared to miss out on was a water filter, so I am quite pleased with the value. I looked at several sources online to get quality ratings of drip coffee makers and this made all the top 10 lists and was frequently in the top 5.

Thosee consistent high ratings, along it's smaller footprint, than many of the higher rated (& priced) units and a curiosity about the insulated carafe, is what convinced me to take a chance.

I'm quite happy with it - Makes a terrific cup a coffee and the carafe keeps the coffee warm and tasty for a couple of hours without any burnt taste. My one quibble is that the carafe is kind of clunky and the pouring from it is s-l-o-w and it's nearly impossible to get the last few ounces out. This also makes it more difficult to wash than it should be. This seems to be a completely avoidable design flaw, that cost it a star. However, overall, I am quite pleased, but I question if I'd be nearly as happy with it, if I had paid the extra $60 for a brand new unit. Still, my last coffee maker (Black & Decker) lasted nearly 20 years and if I get the vastly improved quality of coffee that I've experienced so far for that long, it would be well worth it - Highly recommend, especially if you have limited counter space.",JAIMO,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de enero de 2021
"Rusted After Two Years of Use, But Overall, Pretty Good","4,0 de 5 estrellas","We drink a pot of coffee every day, so a reliable, easy-to-use coffeemaker is important to us. I like this one; it makes a decent pot of coffee. I don't like that you can only see the water level on the right-hand side of it; if that is the side you have near, say, your refrigerator, it's hard to see it; it would be better if the gauge was on the front. And, as other have noted, it's also difficult to pour it all out of the carafe; we end up just taking the lid off to pour. After two years, the biggest issue I have is that the bottom of the machine (what the thermal carafe rests on) has rusted. We haven't done anything to it other than wipe it off with a cloth or sponge. Nevertheless, I'm debating buying the same model again, because, overall, it does do a good job for what it costs.

Two things to know,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a good coffee maker. I like the thermos so that the coffee does not have a burnt coffee taste. One issue is that over time water will leak out of the machine. The machine will work, but you will find water on the counter and wonder from where. The water comes out the bottom. The other thing is that the thermos is hard to clean and the surface lets coffee stick to it like glue.",Frank,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de agosto de 2023

Overall solid coffee maker - requires care though,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Overall I'm happy with this coffee maker and would buy it again. However, if you're gonna buy it there's some things you need to do if you want it to last.

PROS: Excellent coffee. The ""shower head"" evenly heats and uses the grinds. The water level indicator is much easier and more accurate than others. The water filter ensures a cleaner coffee. The 1-4 cups option ensures proper brew time for smaller brews. The carafe keeps the coffee warm for hours.

CONS: The spout is through a hole in the center of the lid that then has a chute out the side of the lid to the spout. This means that it's impossible to get the last half-cup or more out without taking the lid off. In fact, when I pour my coffee I just take the lid off to start with. Even with the lid off, you're still pouring out the ""middle of the top"" so getting the last bits out is hard to do without making a mess. In addition, it's critical that you keep the button of the carafe dry before you put it back in the machine. Others here have reported corroding of the plate - I have avoided that by always wiping the bottom with a paper towel. Relatedly, when you wash the carafe, it's important that you leave it upside down to dry on a rack. I didn't once and I have a few spots on the inside bottom where water sat that's starting to corrode.",Phil,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de enero de 2021
"Grounds end up in your cup, but tasty coffee!","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Ridiculous! Grounds some out the top of the filter and push into the lid of the pot, into the carafe and then into your cup. I prefer my coffee without the crunch. Every coffee maker seems to do this, though haven't tried $600 ones! (As if you should need to pay prices like that.) Going back to manual pour-over.

UPDATE: Keeping this! Tried a pricey coffee maker and found that it produced weak coffee! The flavor of coffee produced by this Cuisinart far surpassed it - will pick out grounds and enjoy a good cup of coffee.",Bookworm,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de julio de 2023

It doesn’t need to. The insulated pot keeps the brew hot and I don’t have to worry about remembering to turn the unit off. I am satisfied with how the coffee comes out and I won’t be breaking this carafe as I have with so many previous, glass ones. I agree with the several reviewers who noted the challenge of pouring coffee from the carafe, especially as it nears being empty.

This One Has the Vacuum-Wall Carafe [Update on Design Flaw],"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Got this for a gift. Had to look hard to find one that actually has vacuum sealed double walls. Don't get one that simply has a double wall carafe, as it won't keep the coffee hot. Most of them are simple double walled. We have an old model of Cuisinart with the vacuum walled carafe, and it keeps the coffee hot for hours, so I wanted to get a similar model. The description doesn't say vacuum sealed walls, so I had to look at the questions and reviews, and when I saw someone say that it keeps coffee hot for hours, I knew I found the right one. Would have been helpful if the description mentioned vacuum sealed double wall carafe, or something like that. My son has confirmed that we got the right one.

[Update in 12/2022: I bought a second one of these for our house, and found a major irritation. The carafe leaks coffee when you pour it. There is a work-around however: Before you pour the first time. back the lid off just a tiny bit (a millimeter or so). Most of the time it doesn't leak after that. It is counterintuitive as one would think that cinching it closed tightly would solve the problem. A design defect in my opinion, but I love the coffee maker otherwise, especially how long the coffee stay hot.]",S. Polson,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de febrero de 2021

"Great coffee maker, but I agree...","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I searched for a coffee maker that was in my price range and had 5 stars. However, the only ones in my price range had 4 stars. I searched through them and decided on this one as I loved my Grind and Brew Cuisinart for the 9 years it lasted. I figured I would stick with Cuisinart, but based on the reviews, did purchase the extra warranty just in case. I have used the coffee pot twice daily for a few weeks and so far so good. It makes a hot, tasty pot of coffee that stays hot longer than my last pot. I agree with the other reviewers who stated that it drips. However, I don't find it to drip exactly, but rather not pour smoothly which results in small splashes on the counter. I have started pouring over the sink and don't find it too much trouble...just a routine to get into. I am sure they can fix the design flaw and they should. However, it is probably a result of the wonderful fact that you do not have to turn the lid to pour and that it is a sure seal to keep the coffee hot. I have not programmed the coffee to start at another time, because I grind my coffee right before making it, so I cannot speak to that. Since the chime at the end of the cycle is louder than on my last coffee maker, I appreciated being able to turn that feature off at 5:30 in the morning.

Good Coffee Lousy Carafe,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","We have been using this coffee maker four and a half months. First several pots had plastic flavor that eventually went away. Now makes very good tasting coffee. 4 stars because: 1) Awkward to pour water into the tank. Gauge is on the right side making it necessary to turn the unit around to see it. Also area to pour in the water is SMALL. 2) Carafe must have been a total afterthought to designers. It does keep the coffee hot for several hours and that is its best point. However, it is nearly impossible to pour a cup of coffee and NOT have it dribble and drip all around the cup. The nearer the pot is to empty the worse the mess. When cleaning the carafe it has to be turned completely upside down and shaken to get rinse water out. If the coffee didn't taste as good as it does this product would have been sent back. Improve the carafe and they would have a GREAT coffee maker.",Busgate,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de septiembre de 2021
"Good coffee, hot for hours, AND convenience","4,0 de 5 estrellas","We're pleasantly surprised at what good coffee this makes. We expected to upgrade when our previous Cuisinart autodrip coffeemaker gave up the ghost after many years. Yet Wirecutter, Consumer Reports, and more coffee-focused review sites steered us away from Cuisinart (coffee tastes like cardboard, one said). But reading between the lines, I discerned that a device that includes a showerhead to evenly moisten the coffee and excludes a hot plate that gradually burns the coffee (and eventually burns out) might make a big difference, and this fit the bill. (We like our coffee fresh ground so never use and can't speak to the programmable features.) An unexpected plus is that the carafe is so well insulated that the coffee in it stays hot for hours. The only drawback, as other reviewers have written, is the design of the carafe—it's heavy, a bit cumbersome, and tends to drip, and it's opening is too small for a hand to fit in to clean. Washing it in a dishwasher puts water inside the walls of the carafe (probably via the screw hole for attaching the handle), so we've learned to just rinse it out well. With no hot plate to burn the coffee inside it, it might escape taking on that burnt coffee smell. All in all, we're glad that we gave Cuisinart another try.",Mark A,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de diciembre de 2020

The only con is that the carafe is difficult to clean. The opening is too small for my hand to get in and clean it down thoroughly, so I use a brush. But I don't have a lot of confidence that the brush is getting under the top of the lid.

Bought it for the thermal carafe,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","We just returned from Europe and couldn't bring our 7-year-old 220V Braun Sommelier machine, which we loved. The main issue for us was the stainless steel thermal carafe that kept the coffee hot for four hours or more without continuing to cook it on a heat plate, also the electricity savings. This Cuisinart was the closest available on Amazon. The carafe keeps the coffee hot, but is very heavy. The openings for the water reservoir are small and require a good aim to keep water out of the filter cone. Not a fan of the gold tone filter. We use a fairly coarse grind but still there is sediment, so now we use a paper filter inside the gold one. Either way, enough coffee for a full 12-cup brew will swell up to the top of the filter, or possibly over, if you like a hearty brew, so we don't use more than 10 cups of water.

Makes good coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffeemaker replaced a Cuisinart Thermal coffeemaker with a hot water thing as part of the whole deal. That hot water thing (to make tea) was horrible. It never worked properly and only made the machine take up space for nothing. This coffeemaker is much better. It has more features, too, and is larger by two cups. I really like the ""Bold"" feature. When the coffee is done and the lid is lifted to remove the cone, I wipe the inside of the lid but water still runs down the back of the machine. It's okay once I noticed; easy to dry. I always put hot water into the carafe once it's empty, just to decrease the staining, but the staining doesn't affect the flavour of the coffee. It's only my own ""quirk""; I prefer the carafe without heavy staining. This coffeemaker also has a much better placement of the water window. It's very easy to see. Some people have complained about using the thermal carafe to fill the coffeemaker with water. We always fill it using a (Tupperware) pouring pitcher. Anything with a good pouring spout works well.

Almost Hot Coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I like everything about this coffee maker except the temperature of the coffee. Even the first cup of the day is just below the temperature I like my coffee, and I even preheat the carafe by running hot water into it and letting it stand for a couple of minutes before I start brewing. In the spirit of full disclosure, I do use cream in my coffee, and that will tend to lower the temperature a few degrees. However, that is all the more reason why I need a HOT cup of joe to begin with. Immediately after brewing, the temperature of the coffee in the carafe is 180 F. In my cup with cream it is only 165 F. The solution has become to put my cup in the microwave for 30 seconds in order to get the nice hot cup of coffee I like, which is not too much of a hardship. This goes for every cup I pour, because coffee left in the carafe never gets any hotter. It only gets cooler because the carafe is not heated in any way after the coffee finishes brewing.

The things I like include...
1. Nice design, easy to clean.
2. Coffee tastes very good, the Bold button does make a bolder cup of coffee
3. Coffee made in the morning tastes fresh all day. You just have to warm each cup in the microwave.",Mike Mack,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de agosto de 2018

I had found the coffee did not brew very hot, and therefore made a very weak cup of coffee initially.... And just to be clear, I use 3/4 cups of coffee to 5 cups of water (1/4 regular, 1/2 decaf) with Allegro or similar beans. I knew the water did not brew hot enough because my first cup was luke warm after putting in cream, and only after the carafe sat on the warmer for a 1/2 hour or so did the coffee get hot. When I tried the bold button, the coffee started brewing hotter. And man! is it bold! I will have to cut back on how much coffee i use, which will save me some money.

The lid is not exactly intuitive, and there is nothing about it in the instructions, but I figured it out without difficulty.

Why only four stars? The carafe, in order to stay hot inside, is a very 'closed' carafe. Even turning the carafe upside down won't get the last 20% of the coffee out. The only way to get the last of the coffee is to remove the carafe lid and then turn the pot completely upside down.

"Very good, but a few things to know","4,0 de 5 estrellas","We've had a number of drip coffee makers and this Cuisinart is our latest. It replaced a very functional KitchenAid 12-cup unit that looked outdated.

I'll answer some seemingly common questions:
The stainless steel thermal carafe is safe for the dishwasher
You can easily substitute paper #4 conical water filters for the gold metal filter that comes with the machine
The operation and controls are very straightforward, in fact almost identical to our old KitchenAid
The water tank cannot be removed for cleaning
It does have the sneak-a-cup feature
The coffee it makes tastes fine and stays warm
It uses a standard and common charcoal water filter

These maybe weaknesses, or justfactoids:
It is difficult to pour fresh water into the tank on the left side, you need pour water into the tank from the right side
Since the carafe is solid stainless, you can't see how many cups of fresh water or brewed coffee it contains without taking off the top
Coffee pours slowly from the carafe and there is no evident way to speed it up
I assumed that the unit had a hot plate under the carafe to keep it warm. It doesn't. The thermal properties off the carafe keep the content warm. While it works, coffee does cool down over time.

Coffee stays hot for almost 24 hours!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","It’s kind of silly to have both a 1-4 cup and bold button, since they both perform the same function. Not a fan of having to constantly choose to turn off the 5-beep (at least 2 more than I need) notice that it’s done brewing. But I love a metal carafe because the coffee truly stays hot all day, and it’s a full 15 cups whereas many others are only 12 cups. Easy to program, and since I trip a circuit this time of year when I run my A/C and microwave at the same time, it’s nice to have a small battery that holds the time while I reset the circuit so I don’t have to reprogram the time whenever that happens.

Keeps coffee hot for a long time. Brews quick.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","The opening on pot is small, need a good brush to clean, can not fit hand into the opening to clean entire inside of pot.
We don't have dishwasher machine, but that method of cleaning would be best.
When you open the top lid to remove filter, condensation from previously brewed coffee drips down the outside of the back of tank, leaves water all over counter.
We just wipe up the mess, but would be nice if that was corrected in new models.",Barrett,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de mayo de 2023

"Good Coffee Maker, But With Design Flaws","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Overall a good coffeemaker, but with three annoying design flaws: it's difficult to fill the tank with water without splashing the coffee into the grounds or outside the tank; it's difficult to see how much water is in the tank with turning the whole contraption around, as the measurements are only visible from one side of the machine; and finally, it's a bit difficult to pour from the thermos, especially the last cup.

In terms of making coffee, it's fine, but in terms of user-friendliness, it's got real shortcomings that I wouldn't expect from this brand, nor at this price point.",lieblink,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de febrero de 2023
Quality product,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This drip coffee maker replaces a 15 year old Cuisinart 10 cup coffee maker. The old coffee maker had a push out tray for loading the coffee grinds ... down side was that the tray could sometimes pop out while coffee was brewing. With this new one, coffee grinds are loaded from the top (no tray to pop out which is a blessing). The front buttons make the brewing selection process easy and light up when selected. I only gave it 4 stars because some users might have a problem lifting a 12 cup carafe filled with water to the top of the coffee maker to fill the reservoir. Being over 6' I did not have that problem but the shorter user might experience the fill issue. We use Melita #4 Bamboo filters and a combination of that filter and this coffee maker make for great cups of java.",BobArc,Revisado en Canadá el 28 de enero de 2020
Satisfied… but,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Overall a good purchase, but there are two things I do not like. Because of the design of the carafe, it is difficult to pour the last few cups of coffee without feeling like you are turning it nearly upside down. It also seems to hold about 2 cups of water in the reservoir. For example, if you pour 8 cups of water in, the built in scale will show 10 cups. Seems like a bad idea to always maintain that amount of water in the coffee maker. Mold or bacteria could grow in that water during long periods of inactivity.

"Decent machine, less-than-decent carafe","4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a good machine. It's easy to use and makes good coffee. The timer feature is likewise easy to use. The design of the carafe, however, and specifically the lid and spout, are less than great. They've managed to design a lid and spout from which it is literally impossible to pour coffee without said coffee dripping all over the counter. I usually assume it's user error but not in this case. I used to own a Mr Coffee thermos style maker and carafe, and that one was tricky in that you had to line up the carafe and drip spout on the machine perfectly or you'd have a gargantuan mess, but the carafe itself never made any mess whatsoever when pouring. Again, solid coffee maker... Not sure why the carafe was so poorly designed.",Robin F.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de enero de 2022
Upgraded my coffee maker,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee maker is a big upgrade over my 5-year old Mr. Coffee (it better be for triple the price). It's easy to use, it looks nice, and it makes a nice cup of coffee. I love using the 1-4 setting and the bold setting when I'm only brewing a couple cups for myself. The timer is very simple to use. I've been using it for about a month now so I haven't had to use the clean function yet but it seems like a great feature. I like that the machine beeps when the brewing cycle is over, but 5 beeps is probably not really necessary. I agree with the complaints that getting the last several ounces of coffee out of the pot isn't easy, and it can get a bit messy, but I'm an adult so I'll either adapt over time or I'll just wipe up the drips. I often use a travel mug but a very wide-rimmed cup can help keep drips from going onto the counter. This is my only reason for not rating 5 stars.",Christine B.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de octubre de 2020

Newer isn't necessarily better.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This latest version of the Cuisinart coffee maker gets five stars, because I'm convinced it's better than what alternatives would have been. However, it's far from perfect.
Biggest defect is the 240 degree angle required to pour coffee out of the carafe. In the process of pouring, the coffee dribbles, so that the spout has to be kept well within the mouth of one's coffee cup: and/or the coffee dribbles onto and down the handsome thermal carafe. Keep a tissue handy.
Speaking of the thermal carafe, yes, it's handsome, but it doesn't keep the coffee hot enough, if one adds cream. The 2014 Cuisinart coffee maker I had before, until it gave out, always kept the coffee piping hot, with or without cream. It had a glass carafe. Plus, the older, better, model didn't dribble. A tiny amout of coffee would collect well within the spout, which could easily be dabbed out with tissue, or simply left as is.
A minor issue is that if one selects the 1-4 cup option by mistake, pushing the 1-4 button to turn off this option, doesn't turn it off.
So, I'm learning to live with this newer Cuisinart coffee maker. I just wish the one I had for nine years hadn't died. - Mike B",Mike B,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de agosto de 2023
Wonderful!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is my 4th purchase of this coffee maker over the past 30 years.

On gym days, I program it so that my coffee is made right before I get home and all I have to do is pour and enjoy after a heard workout!

How does it stay so hot and so fresh for so long?,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I flip flopped back and forth about buying this coffee maker with it’s insulated carafe, or a more traditional model with a glass carafe and warming plate.
This thing defies physics! The coffee stays really hot for a really long time and it stays fresher than any coffee maker we’ve owned.
First off, I think the coffee is hotter to begin with than most coffee makers so that’s something. Our experience is that I tend to make a full pot of coffee at 6AM, and we finish it off about 9:30AM and the last cup is probably 85% as hot (still hot, not warm) and exceptionally fresh tasting.
These are all upsides.

The down, it’s hard to get all the water poured into the reservoir without spilling some of it on the counter.

That’s all I can say. It makes great coffee. It stays hot and fresh. And as long as I wipe up a couple tablespoons of water off the counter.

A total winner.",EMcB,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de julio de 2023

Great coffee machine for price!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I read reviews on coffee machines and we selected this Cuisinart DCC-1850 with thermal carafe (don't have to worry about breaking a glass decanter, & the thermal carafe is heavy duty & keeps the coffee hot!). The 1-4 cup feature is nice as we don't need to brew a full pot usually. But it's nice to have the 12-cup option when we have family or friends over. Machine is easy to use, just run it thru a cycle of water before you start brewing coffee. Comes with Gold tone filter & a couple paper filters if you prefer that. Also comes with a charcoal water filter (1), so if you are using tap water and you live in Flint Michigan or L A., you will need to buy more charcoal filters. We use bottled water so no need to use the charcoal filter. You can program this coffee maker to brew at a certain time, and it also has a BOLD button if you like stronger tasting coffee.

Outstanding Value - Learn from the Videos,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I invested several days researching to replace my Keurig as I missed having an ""excellent"" cup of coffee in the morning upon waking and throughout the day without scalding. One cannot go wrong with this well designed, constructed, easy to operate coffee maker and thermal pot. Everything Cuisinart states and demonstrates in their videos is absolutely true. Follow the simple directions, yes, it may take a few more prep minutes. The reward is unbelievable and shocking. The difference is indescribable, but very obvious at the first taste.

Do what works best. Buy fresh beans, replacing with new every 2 weeks according to your consumption. Invest in a quality programmable coffee grinder to get it right everytime. Grind only what you need for 1-4 cups or the full 12 cups. Use the gold filter versus paper. Only, only use purified water, whether purchased or having your own water purifying system such as the ultramax 1.3 gallon Brita. It requires approximately 1/2 gallon of purified water to produce 12 cups of amazing coffee. A thermal pot is a must as I have enjoyed yesterday morning's coffee into this afternoon, either microwaved hot or especially over ice for iced coffee. Key to long term HOT coffee, prep the pot with very hot water and let the full pot stand for about 10 to 15 minutes. The temp of the water before and after brewing is extremely important. The pot is now primed for the HOT coffee and shall remain very warm up to 10 hours later.

If you have never experienced a very well made cup of coffee as the professional tasters will tell you, the is a grand life changing surprise in store for you. If you are a coffee veteran, go ahead, I dare you to take this route. No more grossly over-priced Starbucks for me, because my coffee is far superior. You cannot go wrong with this investment. I know from experience this product will ""serve you"" for several years. It's great to be back and have that wonderful aroma and clean vivid flavor and taste of this coffee in the morning..., and afternoon,... and even into the evening.

Thermos works as expected,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this coffeemaker to replace an older Cuisinart that gave up the ghost after 15 - 20 years, and I expect this one to last just as long o longer.

Pros: The thermos carafe keeps the coffee hot for a long time, and the heating element turns off after the brewing is complete, so the element should last a long time, as opposed to the older model that kept the element on for 1+ hours. This also maintains the flavor of the coffee better, as the element is not continuously overheating the coffee in contact with the bottom of the carafe.

Cons: The thermos carafe is heavy, and you can't see how much coffee is left. An additional nitpick is that the design of the carafe top is such that totally emptying it is quite difficult, there is always a small amount of liquid left behind. Because it is a thermos bottle, the carafe has to be washed by hand, so you'll need a brush to get to the interior bottom and sides.

If maintaining the coffee flavor is important to you, this is a great machine. If you value convenience over flavor, then get one of the machines with a glass carafe.",J. Garmendia,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de septiembre de 2022
Good Hot Coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I just can't learn that just because something is ""working"" doesn't mean it's working well. Our old coffee maker still made good coffee but the display was too dim to read and it stuck on the cleaning cycle and wouldn't change. We were facing the likelihood that it was soon going to stop all together. And we were sad. Wow. The first morning with this one was a real eye opener. This one makes hot coffee and good coffee ! This is spectacularly better coffee than we were drinking even though it's the same coffee beans and water we have used for years. And having all the buttons on the front so you just press the one you need. No pressing a menu button then pressing 3 times for this or 4 times for that. Very straight forward and user friendly. I miss the removable reservoir that our old one had. But I now have a water pitcher and know just how much to fill and pour into the coffee maker to get it to the level we want. The stainless pot is a bit difficult to clean and dry inside but not a deal breaker. We drink coffee over about 1 1/2 to 2 hours each morning and that's it. The last cup we drink is as hot as the first but can't say if that's true after 2 hours. With the old coffee maker it never tasted quite as good after it cooled a bit in the cup and sometimes the last cup wasn't quite as good as the first. This is good to the absolute last drop. We are loving it. I should also add that we have decided to go to the unbleached paper filters rather than the gold permanent filter we have always used. Maybe that helps the flavor, too, who knows. We started thinking that the permanent filters likely retain oils that never can thoroughly be rinsed or washed away. Our experience with this coffee maker has been 5 stars so far.",Debpasc,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de mayo de 2019

Flexible Coffee Maker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this as an update to an earlier, much similar model Cuisinart coffee maker. I do hope it is similar in longevity. I used the old one since about 2008 without trouble. I did go through the cleaning routine now and then. I do find with both of these coffee makers you do well to pre-heat the thermal carafe. If I don't the coffee is a bit short of the 170 °F sipping temperature I like to have it at after I pour it into one of my heavy mugs. Pre-heating also allows the coffee to remain ""hot"" a good bit longer. But if you don't give a damn about these relative fine points, all you need do is come up with a proper bean ground properly, a clean machine and fresh water, a few button pushes...incidentally, you can buy the water filters for a significantly lower cost online if you go with ""brand X."" Why not do so. Or filter the water separately and forget about the machine's filter altogether. Or even forget about filtering at all. Cheers.",T,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de julio de 2022
100% Awesome Coffee Maker Machine - Love it,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We are big coffee fans. We drink coffee all the time, all day long but making coffee is not always fun and it can take a lot of time to do it each and every time. If you don't want to make it at home you have to spend $$ to get it at a restaurant. Here comes your savior, Cuisinart 12 Cup Programmable THERMAL Coffeemaker. We recently visited family in NY and noticed they owned one, after 1 week of drinking their coffee from this wonder machine we were sold. I immediately ordered one online and 2 days later was setting it up in our kitchen. It has been few weeks now of non stop coffee and we love it. You can set time and programm when you want coffee brewed. You can choose to brew 12 cups if you are having guests or stick to smaller number that will meet your daily coffee needs (we use 8 cups). I read some other reviews that complained about number of scoops you have to use and started with 8 coffee scoops for 12 cups, but that was making our coffee too strong, so after some experimenting, we settled on 6 scoops for 12 cups, which ends up being 0.5 scoops per 1 cup. Now for 8 cups brew we use 4 scoops and all is good. Thermal coffee canister is AWESOME, keeps coffee nice and hot for 4 hours easily. I have actually experienced warm coffee 6 hours after original brew, which in my opinion is Fantastic. Pouring coffee out of the canister is little bit slow, but I believe this is part of the design that keeps it HOT for so long. I don't know how you like your coffee but I prefer mine is HOT longer. Bottom line, product is awesome, gets the job done and allows us to enjoy HOT delicious coffee every morning.",Jakub Kudlacz,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de septiembre de 2018
Our favorite drip coffee maker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This drip coffee maker creates near perfect coffee. The temperature of the water is ideal, and gets evenly distributed amongst the grounds with a shower head style drip. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours after brewing, with no heating element that would cook the coffee after the brew. The controls allow for setting an automatic brew time for those mornings where efficiency wins out over just-ground-beans freshness.

This is also very easy to clean. There’s a replaceable water filter that is very easy to swap out. The filter basket separates from the unit, lifts out easily, and is very easy to rinse out. If you overfill the filter basket, grounds can adhere to the shower head, but it wipes off easily with a paper towel. I do wish the opening at the top of the carafe was a tad larger so that my hand could fit inside for easier cleaning, but that’s a minor gripe.

We have bought this coffee maker 3 times now, with the prior purchases lasting 3 or 4 years with heavy use, daily 10 to 12 cups. The fault that typically drives us to replacement is inconsistency in the coffee brew temperature (often accompanied by the power cord getting a bit warm), as well as the inner part of the carafe becoming stained and hard to clean. If it wasn’t so inexpensive, we’d likely just buy a replacement carafe and heating element.",Paul Hooper,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de julio de 2021
Why did I wait so long,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Let me start by saying I'm a coffee addict! I'm also a coffee snob. I've owned a Nespresso for a year and stopped using it after 6 months because I hated the coffee options. Even their ""boldest"" one tasted weak and water down to me. I had to give it away. It was taking up precious counter space. I've done the hand pour thing but had no patience for that in the mornings. My favorite method was french press but it was such a process every single time and the waiting period before even my first cup in the morning was sheer torture...I was literally counting the minutes. I decided I needed to invest in a coffee maker and so began the search. Originally I wanted the Smeg, but after reading the poor reviews, decided against it. I own other Cusinart kitchen items and its been a trusted brand for years and years for me. The reviews for this was great and this coffee maker did NOT DISAPPOINT! It checked all my boxes. I got the stainless carafe so my coffee keeps hotter longer. I've tested this numerous times since getting it. I brew my coffee at 6am and at 10:30am when I'm pouring my last cup, its still piping hot! You actually see the steam billowing as you pour the coffee. Just a few things to note. If you keep your coffee maker underneath a cabinet, since this unit sits tall, you will have to pull it out to pour water in and put your coffee grounds into the top. Mine's not underneath a cabinet so this hasn't been an issue for me. I'm happy I decided to go with the stainless carafe instead of the glass...definitely worth the extra $. I like that there's a ""bold"" button if you like your coffee on the stronger side. Cleaning the carafe can be slightly nuisance if you have large hands but I've found using a bristled cup cleaner helps. accomplish this. Highly recommend if you love coffee.",NYCGIRL,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de octubre de 2019
DCC-3400P1 is a good machine,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","It's annoying that the reviews are for a dozen totally different coffee makers, but the DCC-3400P1 is a good one. Flavor is good, the capacity is large, and the machine looks nice. The carafe is insulated so there's no heater to make the coffee taste burnt. It makes an annoying beep but it can be muted. It does require a little charcoal filter, but comes with 1 installed and a spare. The coffee is noticeably hotter than that of my prior OXO machine. Comes with a gold mesh basket or you can use #4 filters. Good size for the countertop, actually smaller footprint than my prior machine that only made 8 cups - this one goes up to 12.

My only negative comment is the pour spout of the carafe doesn't funnel into a nice stream so if you don't pour very close to the mug, it kinda sprays droplets to the sides. It's also not super easy to clean the carafe. Even though the top is wide, the actual opening is about the size of a tennis ball. Anyway, 5 stars.",Brandon,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de abril de 2022

Keeps coffee warm without burning it. Yum!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Got this cause my lady wakes up at the crack of dawn and by the time I get up coffee always tastes awful. I wanted a machine that brews into a thermal carafe as opposed to one that stays warm with a heating element. The ones I'd seen before had smaller carafes. This one does the trick and with the larger stainless thermal carafe, there's always enough for us both. The quality of the coffee in my cup has improved.

Also it is really easy to clean. My last model Cuisinart Coffee maker got a lot dirtier around the shower head just above the grounds. That one held up nicely too, my neighbor snagged it when I offered. This model has a larger shower pattern, it seems higher/further from the coffee grounds than the last model as it doesn't need much cleaning, a cursory wipe between brews at most, and even then the towel comes away mostly clean.

Only issue is it is a little hard to pour, especially the last few drops, it comes out slowly too. I think this is due to the thermal top. It keeps the coffee nice and warm for a long time without a heating element to make the coffee bitter, so small price, and not a big issue for me.

If you want your coffee to last longer and need a decent size carafe, I totally recommend this machine. For me it was worth the difference in price.",Marc A Sheridan,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de enero de 2021

GREAT Coffee Maker -- An awesome Upgrade,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee maker is an upgraded version of one I have had for 10 years that finally croaked. This one is even better -- the backlit display is even easier to read, and the buttons make more sense now (individual buttons for each function, rather than one button in the center of a dial). The stainless steel finish and blue LED lighting match the hot pot and toaster oven which occupy the same counter. I also like the ""new hotter coffee"" feature. For the coffee connoisseur, a cone filter and thermal carafe are very important in brewing coffee ""just so"". It says warm for several hours without added heat, which helps to maintain flavor and quality. It is important to note that a lot of people have complained about the spout. It does take some getting used to, but it's NOT defective and it's NOT unworkable. I can pour an entire carafe into various thermoses and cups and not spill more than a couple of tiny drops. The secret is not to force it -- if you're one of those people who can't do anything before you've had a cup of coffee, maybe this isn't for you. For the rest of us, gradually tilt the carafe as you go -- if you tip it up too much, it WILL splash everywhere, because the volume of the liquid flowing out exceeds the capacity of the cap to let air in, so it sucks in through the spout and disrupts the stream. For that last bit, it's a good idea just to take the lid off of to pour it.

Makes HOT coffee!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Love it, so far! It makes very hot coffee, and keeps it that way for hours, w/o need of any “keep warm” element. I usually “pre-make” our coffee the night before. That feature works flawlessly. If I wake up before auto-brew feature has begun, I pre-heat carafe w/hot water for a minute or two, then brew manually. This will keep coffee hot for a good 3 1/2 to 4 hours, and longer. It will still be wam after 8 or 10 hours! Amazing!
I use old, glass carafe to fill water tank, as units metal carafe pours too slowly.(fine for pouring hot coffee).",Lawrence,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de julio de 2023
Overall is an excellent machine,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Cuisinart DCC-3400 Thermal Coffeemaker, Carafe, overall is an excellent machine. Note that I've only had it about a month. This was a purchase made from frustration with the typical ""glass"" carafes with most machines. I always break them, then must replace the whole machine. Waste of money and upsetting to boot. Stainless steel was a logical choice, but expensive. Two drawbacks, more a nuisance than a complaint. 1) The water fill spot is narrow, wedged in the back right side corner. I use a funnel to pour the water into it, so problem solved. 2) Except for the first two cups, the carafe pours steadily albeit slowly, due to the seal between the carafe and the lid to it. Not unexpected, as air must be permitted to enter to let the coffee pour out. Plus on this is I'm less likely to miss the cup while pouring, and it has a hefty pour spout too, so aiming is no problem, no drips.

On the plus side, it makes a terrific cup of coffee, at least for me, and I use cheap coffee. Five loud beeps sound when the pot is done. Coffee stays warm for about an hour, but a microwave is required if you want it hot after, depending on taste. Plus here is your coffee is never burnt due to a hot plate. (it doesn't have one.) Coffee hours later, no problem, just warm it in your cup. Tastes just like fresh.

Controls are the simplest in any machine I've had, and I've lost count of them. Easy to clean, it's self cleaning with vinegar & seems to work great. Allow at least 30 minutes for the cycle, and it notifies you when it needs cleaning. I have not used the charcoal filter, so no opinion. Now, lets see if I can manage to break this one?",Monte K.

Best tasting coffee ever!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The taste in coffee is like night and day compared to the older style bottom heated coffee burner of my old coffee maker. I use Arabica whole coffee beans and grind them the night before I set up my coffee maker. The old one produced a bland coffee flavor and of course used more electricity heating and burning the coffee too. This Cuisinart brings out the true Arabica coffee bean flavor that was really noticeable the first time AND keeps the coffee hot in the thermos style pot. As other have said, it is awkward to pour. I make two cups of coffee. The first cup pours out just fine. But to get the second cup out, I must remove the lid and tip the pot completely upside down. Some coffee can splatter out if I'm not careful. For someone who has arthritis, this might be a problem.
I'm on my second cup and it is still hot. Despite what I have to do, this coffee maker makes such good tasting coffee, it's a keeper! Easy to fill coffee and water, clean, etc. Some friends have this same model, which I didn't know, and when I asked them about theirs, they said they're very happy with it.",Jetsetmantony,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de abril de 2021
Best Cuisinart I bought so far,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",I see all these millennials that don't know how to hand wash. I guess they grew up with just a dishwasher. ask your self how would you clean a bottle? if you all owned a Cuisinart for all theses years like you claim did you read the manual? this coffee machine not only makes hot beautiful coffee with no pre heating. It's not in this manual but the 1-4 cup button makes the water hotter and bold brews it slower to get more flavor. the other beauty about this machine is the burner doesn't stay on using your electricity. this carafe is a slow poorer like a teapot if you tip it to much it will leak out the fill/breather hole. If you want to clean it use a little bleach and a bottle brush to remove the stains or Colgate toothpaste.stop your crying and go ask your mother if you don't know how to use a simple coffee machine or read the manual.

My Favorite Coffee Make to date,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This was our fourth Cuisinart coffee maker in about 15 years. We always purchase the models with the Carafe. We've had the one that is the Grind and Brew, the tall 12 cup model and an older version like this one. They have improved many of the classic features to where now I actually use them. I actually use the auto start feature now as it is much easier to set the time of day and the auto time. I love that you can turn the alarm off on this model as it did always did seem a bit loud at 6 am. This model has a small batch setting which is great when only making a couple cups. The tall model we used to have would often flood over. I think alot of this was caused by grinding the coffee too fine. We bought a Burr grinder and grind at medium and that resolved the problem most of the time. This model has never flooded over in three months of use. The coffee is very hot even an hour after brewing. We also like the low profile of this unit as it fits under the cabinets in our new house which is why we needed to ditch the tall one. My only complaint if I have to come up with one is that if the unit gets unplugged then you'll need to reset the time and auto time. Not a big deal but we could use more outlets in our kitchen so it gets unplugged often.",ejb,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de agosto de 2019
Great taste and lasting heat,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Love this coffee maker! I used to use the kind that held the coffee inside the coffee maker, not in a carafe and you would push a lever to get the coffee out. I work from home and have coffee throughout the day and I didn't like the carafe sitting on a burner for hours and creating that burnt coffee taste so I switched. I liked those but the coffee stream while ""pouring"" continued to slow over time to the point you couldn't use it anymore. This thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours without the burner. I'm thrilled, it's a much better solution. This is just what I was looking for: great taste, hot coffee, lasting heat, no burnt coffee taste.

Makes a great cup of hot coffee and it’s easy to use.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I had this same coffee maker except 10 cup for at least 10 years. After reading many reviews I was a little concerned it was not made as well. I use the program on my coffee pot, this is the twelve cup. I love waking up to my coffee. It is so easy to program. I’m 65 so if I can do it anyone can. I do run hot water from my faucet to rinse it out at night. I fill the reservoir with water. I’m not sure why people were complaining about the lid. You just turn it and it locks into place where the spout is? I usually use the brown cone filters#4 but I’m now using the reuseable gold basket that came with it. Dump the grounds and rinse it out. If I’m going to take the pot out before it’s completed I get one drop that drops onto the burner. I just take a paper towel or my sponge and wipe it, no big deal. Is the coffee hot. My son and family were staying over for the weekend. I handed by son a cup of coffee the next morning. He’s like wow mom wasn’t expecting it to be that hot! I do want to mention the old one I had the sprayer was small that goes onto the grounds. This was large and makes a fabulous cup of coffee. I’ve had this maker for several months.",ABjones,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de agosto de 2018
I think twelve years is a pretty darn good run,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I'm giving this coffee maker a five star rating, and here is why. I am a previous owner of a Cuisinart programmable coffee maker. I've had mine since I believe 2005. Before this I had three Bunn coffee makers which lasted a total five-six years. I had to replace my old cuisinart because it started leaking water from the bottom of the coffee maker, not the carafe. I think twelve years is a pretty darn good run! My husband said he wanted the same coffee maker. Well here we are twelve years later and I was able to purchase this one. Super easy setup, came with a 12 cup thermal carafe for a darn good price! Twelve years ago I paid $149.99 just for the coffee maker and an additional $49 for a thermal carafe. I would most likely have paid that price again. My old one made really good coffee, and I know this one will also!

Just updating as I've had the coffee maker for two days now and I am very happy with it! I didn't notice until after I gave a review that this new coffee maker has a water measure on the outside of the unit! I am so excited about this I can see how much water I'm putting in it without having to stand on my tiptoes to look inside! I love this coffee maker!",Denise C.

Nice Coffee Maker!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I used the much older Cuisinart coffee maker and am happy that we bought this later version. It works so well, makes the coffee taste so good, stays HOT and is easy to use. The only negative I have is that it doesn't seem to pour easily from the carafe into the water well but I've worked around that... just hold the carafe higher when pouring. All in all, this is a great product! We were so impressed that we bought one for my son and DIL (and they love it)!",Debbie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de junio de 2023
Great coffee maker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We use bottled spring water to make coffee. Our previous coffee makers water lines/heating system were clogging up with calcium and we had to clean monthly or so with vinegar.
With the water charcoal filter we have had no issues at all! Which is convenient for us.
Also cleaning the stainless steel coffee pot is a kiss.
Very happy with this coffee maker and highly recommend it!

One of the best !!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have been using this coffee maker for about six months now and I could not be more pleased ! It makes a great cup of coffee if you use good quality beans. It is easy to use & clean, quiet, brews quickly, and the thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot all morning. The internal filter helps to improve the taste ( we have hard water. ) This unit does not have a lower heating element and therefore you do not get burnt coffee on the heating pad or the bottom of the carafe. I have read that some people have complained that this unit beeps so loudly that it ""wakes up the whole house."" It does beep five times when the brew cycle is done, but unless you have your family sleeping on your kitchen counters, the beeps are not that loud.

One last thing... The Cuisinart Stainless Steel Thermal Coffeemaker is not a miracle worker. The unit does make some of the most flavorful coffee I have had at home, but it will not make a silk hat out of a pigs ear. If you use average coffee beans it will give you average coffee. But to be honest, if you use good quality beans , I have never had a coffee maker that produced better results !!! The cup of coffee it makes is consistently rich and flavorful !!",P.
