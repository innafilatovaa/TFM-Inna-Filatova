It makes a stronger cup of coffee than the Keurig I had in the past, which is what I was ultimately looking for in my next single serve machine. I like how I can grind the exact amount I need for a consistently good cup of coffee without waste. I would recommend getting the paper filter liners just like you would a traditional coffee maker. The handful of negative reviews about the grinder creating a mess are correct. This isn’t a deal breaker for me since they fall right into a tray that can very easily be dumped after use. I never use the k-cups anymore because grinding the beans is quick and easy.

"Easy to Use, Compact, & Perfect for Single Households","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've had this one perhaps one month now, and so far - so good. No complaints. As I am currently a single household, this is perfect for making one cup at a time, so there's no wasted and undrunk coffee. It's also quite compact and takes minimal room on the countertop.

Since I can grind beans as well as brew already-grounded coffee beans, I have the full spectrum of coffee brands available. I'm actually drinking more coffee now than previously using the popular instant coffee brands, and I'm finding the 'new' coffee both more tasteful and which also imparts less 'shock & stress' to my system, so the latter result is also probably another reason why I'm drinking more coffee than previously as my system tolerates it better.",Zemu_U,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de junio de 2024

Unusable within 8 months of purchase and customer service is no help!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Was extremely pleased at the function of this machine, but that changed quickly. Started to notice that the machine was only producing about 6 oz of coffee from time to time and would have to re-run the brew. The pod holder would slightly pop open during the brew cycle which would stop the machine from brewing. I used a large rubber band and would slide that over the outside pod holder and this stopped the problem ($200 machine with a rubber band holding it together is a bit ridiculous but ok), then it began having issues where the buttons would not register you pushing them. I found if you unplugged and plugged it back in a few times it would reset. I reached out to Cuisinart a total of 5 times with no remedy. On one call I was told to call another day because the rep was “swamped” (wish I was joking!), one rep told me he was having a system outage and would call me back (7 months and still awaiting his call), one rep said she would send me a return label and once they got the machine they would review to see if I DESERVED a replacement (never got the label), upon calling back in to get that label I was told they don’t do replacements and was disconnected, next rep again said they would send a label for return and to expect a replacement in 10-14 days once they received the unit (not sure how you make coffee for a month without a machine… but ok) but again the label never arrived by email, mail or carrier pigeon! I finally gave up!

Messy & Possibly Possessed,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this coffee maker to use at work. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and appreciate freshly ground beans. I've never been able to embrace the Keurig. I've been using it now for about 18 months. In spite of its short comings it does (did) make a pretty good cup of coffee. Now those short comings.... 1. There is no way to adjust the fineness of the grind... it's on the course side and there's no changing it. 2. When it brews it spits coffee.... not a nice stream into the cup...but some kind of angry spattering. 3. The grinding is very loud and grounds go everywhere.... I mean... beyond the drip tray. And now... 18 months later...I think she has finally given up the ghost... push the brew button, that gets you some wheezing and coughing and about half and ounce of wetness in the cup.

Now I put the pod below the holder and tap the grinder again to remove remaining grounds. With the k-cups I pierce the bottom twice to lessen the water drippage. Not solved is the clouding inside the grinder. I think the flavored coffee left an abrasive coating. I haven’t found something to replace it.

Best of both worlds.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Grind fresh coffee beans for your morning coffee, or use a pod. Learning to use the machine will take a bit, but once you have mastered it, it is easy. Let me explain. You grind the coffee beans into the provided special pod with a screen. Then, you remove the pod ring attachment from the coffee dispenser. Insert the pod with the fresh coffee grounds into the dispenser and choose your volume. When you place the pod ring back in, make sure the arrow points upwards towards the back of the machine or face liquid leaks and messy cleanup. That's the bad part.

There is a convenient storage bay for either the pod ring or the coffee grounds holder.

"Poor quality, poor taste, lots of clean up","2,0 de 5 estrellas","The concept is great:
- Combines grinder and brewer, taking less space,
- Makes single cup, which is good since I'm the only coffee drinker in my household,
- Relatively inexpensive.

However, after using it for just over 6 weeks, I have to recommend against buying this product. The design and construction are very shoddy. Here are a few reasons:
- The reusable filter cup has a little plastic latch that keeps it closed. That latch broke after a few weeks of use, such that it doesn't fully close anymore (see picture). It's still usable, but leads to more ground spill.
- The burr mill makes a mess, a lot of the grounds fall off to the side or below, even around the machine, requiring a regular cleaning.
- The burr mill got stuck after just a month of use; I cleaned it as the manual recommends, and it got stuck again the next day.
- The reusable filter is hard to clean. I shake it and hit it over the trash can and most grounds remain stuck there. I need to send a lot of water through at high pressure to get it empty, and then most of the grounds fall in my sink and it seems like a waste of water.
- The coffee quality is subpar when making 12 oz. The last 1-2 oz is just warm water.
- There is a side compartment to store the reusable filter cup. Since I am using the reusable filter cup every day, I leave it in the brew chamber until the next day, so I don't need that compartment. I thus use it to store the capsule holder, which I generally don't use and has very similar dimensions to the reusable filter cup. However, when I do that, the side compartment doesn't close properly. So I either have to leave the side compartment not fully closed (see picture), or store the capsule holder elsewhere in my kitchen, leaving the side compartment empty and useless. That's a very obvious design flaw.

Despite those problems, Cuisinart declined to refund the machine, even partially, because I was just past the 30-day limit. That's $110.00 lost. I wouldn't pay any more than $40.00 for this machine.",Vincent,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de mayo de 2024
It's a keeper,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought the coffeemaker only because I had guests who might not like my usual store-brand instant coffee. After learning how easy it was to use and tasting the improved coffee, I decided to keep it for myself. It does drop a few grounds after grinding. The item page does now mention that you need to tamp the ground coffee before brewing which might make it easier to clean inside the brewing chamber. A previous reviewer suggested buying extra filter cups, which makes sense because the lid doesn't close evenly after clumsy use.

Disapointed in Cuisinart,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I have had at least 5 Cruisinart grind and brews over the last 20+ years and loved these machines. This one, however is definitely not worth the purchase. I was excited to see this product as I am now the only one in my house. The grind feature is messy as it grinds more coffee than the hopper can hold and leaves a mess on the bottom and the amount of beans is not adjustable for the amount of coffee you wish to brew. The mesh filter is hard to clean and I end up with grinds in my trash and sink. The area around the grind basket get dirty and is also a pain to clean even though this model comes with a brush. The pod holder is hard to maneuver as it is tricky to get it in just the right spot. I threw this machine out and went to a french press which makes great coffee and is easier to use even though I grind beans and use my electric tea pot for hot water.",Shirley Renner,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de mayo de 2024

When I saw this single serve brewer with the grinder I had to have it. Also bought one for my sons family, who also grind and brew. So why the 4 star rating (it's really 4 1/2 stars) is that the bean hopper is not removable. So when I switch from beans with caffeine to decaf I have to remove the water tank (easily done) and the drip catcher and turn the entire unit upside down to empty it. The same routine is used when cleaning the grinder attachment. I am still working on exactly how many beans make one 12 oz cup.

Now, it does make a nice cup of coffee, but then you have to remove the filter, clean it out, rinse it out, and start all over. Bit of a hassle… my last machine did all that for you.

Well designed and attractive unit. Unfortunately the coffee tasted odd,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I was very excited when I received this unit. I had been using a Bodum filter press coffee maker for many years and had been using pre-ground coffee. I wanted to try to Up My Game by getting a unit with an integrated grinder so I could use whole beans and get a fresher tasting cup.

Unfortunately, when I tried some test brews using my existing pre-ground coffee the coffee had an odd plasticky / metallic taste? I had followed the initial cleaning instructions / installed the rinsed * soaked filter as instructed and used the same coffee and water as I would in my old filter press.

I thought it was perhaps just my perception, so I ran a quick test using the filter press as a control.

I made 10 oz. cups using the same water and pre-ground coffee in the Bodum and the Cuisinart (I doubled the amounts for the Bodum as I don't usually just have 1 cup, but the ratios were the same).

I let the Bodum steep for about 4 minutes (as I usually do) and then turned on the Cuisinart.

Checked the temperature of the finished brews and they were within about 5 degrees (160-165F).

The result confirmed what I thought. The Cuisinart brew definitely had a plasticky / metallic aftertaste that was completely absent from the Bodum. This seems really odd to me given that the Cuisinart has the added feature of the activated carbon filter.

For all I know perhaps this is how coffee from units like this typically taste, since its the first I have ever owned. After all, the Bodum I use does not really have any plastic parts (its just glass and a stainless steel screen).

Although I really hate to return items, that is what I will likely do with this unit.

Pros: The unit is extremely well engineered, it looks great and works exactly as advertised ( I did not actually use the grinder though, so can't comment on that). It fits in a small space and is very reasonably priced.

Cons: The only one for me was the slight off-taste.",Andrew,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de enero de 2024

Fantastic coffee.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Im only writing this review because it would be a shame for someone to miss out on one of the best cups of coffee you may ever have.

Yes it is a bit messy if you arent the most careful person or plan for the expected. But the machine is cheap compared to any other machine that does what it does. If you want perfect, pay the price for perfect.

Here's how I use it. I place a disposable paper filter in the a reusable filter cup and when Im sliding it in and out of the grinder, I tilt it forward to not mess up the paper filter and tilt it backward a bit when taking it out, but not before a few taps and a shake to make sure the grinds are in place.

The grind and amount of coffee is fine and I brew an excellent cup at the full 12oz for my everyday cup.

The grinder does drop a few grinds each grind, so I keep a finger bowl there to catch them and toss them into the next cup. I dont try to appear like I live in a magazine, so the look of this doesnt bother me.

But what's important is the coffee; its delicious. Smooth, low acid and full flavored. I would buy this machine over and over again no matter its little flaws. I recommend it to all my friends. Its better than any cafe, Starbucks acidic burnt bean sugar fest and/or bistro I've ever had. Enjoy!",The Whiz,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de abril de 2024
"Finally, a hybrid coffee maker that I am happy with","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Over the years I have tried making coffee with various K cup machines including other Cuisinarts with pods and grind your own k cup dispensers (e.g. Java Jig), grind and drip using a caraffe, conventional drip coffee with paper filter etc to find a flavor that I was looking for and that was effortless and fast for a household solo coffee drinker. Lets face it k cup coffee lacks flavor and freshness that you get from a of a drip type maker or or drip cafaffe with your own beans. Well the cuisinart single serve is the best compromise I have seen. Grinding beans is easy and quick (and quite quiet compared to my stand alone grinder) and the custom grind housing is easy to insert/remove and clean - something I find extremely useful. Putting the holder in and out for the custom grind or k cup canister is simple and both are easy to clean - something that has always bothered me with other dual purpose k cup/grind machine. It makes good coffee with a pod or custom grind although I prefer grinding my own. The features are barebones - no timers/extra strong blend/clock features etc which actually is an asset.
Ok so the negatives - the grinder is a bit messy leaving ground coffee on the drip tray (the carriage holder for the grinder could be a bit more snug), the water dispenser is low capacity which is okay because I never left water standing in my makers preferring cold filtered water but the design of the water well is such that you have to be careful as you pour in water or you will get a spash from the water hitting the back wall of the reservoir which juts out into the water fill area. In SUMMARY for a hybrid machine (grind and k cup) it provides a good cup of coffee using EITHER method, has a small footprint with a nice ergonomic, functional design and makes this coffee snob quite happy.",Ken,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de noviembre de 2023
"Flavor of coffee not good with supplied insert, made of plastic and metal affected taste but!","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I like the idea of grind for one cup, for me that good cause I am only one that drinks coffee in household, and you boil water with it for tea if needed. First the flavor overall was OK but when I replaced the insert that supplied with my own stainless steel replacement coffee reusable you get 2 in pack on Amazon, the coffee strength was very good like it should be, and the factory ones broke and were not balanced for a good cup of coffee. The stainless new holders were used with factory plastic top and plastic hold, they filled with grounder up to the full top when grinder shut off. Without this change i was really dissatisfied with taste so if you get this unit, do what I did and don't use their insert. Another inconvenience is you cannot take out the glass insert that holds the coffee beans and it would be nice as we could have another one with different beans like decaff on a quick change basis. Also, if you have to remove beans there is no easy way to do that and they go all over the place when you take bottom blade assembly off. I think a better way is to turn the machine upside down without water tank etc. and remove them that way. I am keeping machine now that the coffee tastes as it should with my modifications.

A hot mess that makes a delicious cup of fresh brew!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","What I like about it: the coffee maker makes an incredibly fresh and flavorful cup of Joe. I also enjoy the look and style of the unit and have received many compliments so far.

What I would change about the coffee maker: 1) the design of the fillable capsule / k-cup does not allow for a tight fit when inserting it under the grinder, that being so, when grinding the beans, ground coffee spills out from the dispenser. 2) capacity, the water reservoir and bean grinder does not hold very much and must be refilled if you are a frequent coffee drinker.

Takeaway: My household looks forward to the great taste of this machine's coffee. It's a bit inconvenient needing to clean up the grinds that don't make it into the refillable capsule. Ultimately we don't mind too much and we place a short coffee cup underneath the capsule while it's being filled to catch the overfill. Had we other options to choose from (unable to find another single serve grinding kcup unit on Amazon) we would have returned this and chose something else. Until there are other makers popping up that can do what this lil guy does, we'll grin & bear the hot mess as the fresh ground brew taste is very worth it.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de diciembre de 2023
BEST Fresh Ground Bean to Cup Single Serve!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've tried them all, and this Cuisinart Single Serve Coffee Maker with a built-in grinder wins the day for a hot, delicious cup of fresh-ground coffee on demand. Pods? Why? Bags of pre-ground coffee? Why? Not when you can have fresh ground AND adjust the amount of grounds for each cup of coffee. My current daily beans are Counter Culture's Fast Forward, which is a washed, medium blend of African and South and Central American beans with nutty, sweet, and creamy notes. (For a slightly darker roast, I like Blue Bottle Giant Steps or Bella Donavon). I grind these an extra 2 seconds past the default grind and select the 8 oz cup option, which I dispense into a coffee cup containing a splash of pre-heated (35 seconds in the microwave) milk. Delicious! As good as or better than the daily coffee at any of the boutique coffee shops in my area. For a 10 oz cup, grind an additional 4-5 seconds past default, although I prefer the extraction of the 8 oz option. I've never tried grinding and brewing the 12-cup option.

PRO TIP: Go ahead and buy a couple of extra reusable filter cups for a quicker, more convenient second (or third) cup. Also, readying a just-used reusable filter cup is simple: just remove the filter basket from the grey cup, turn it upside down, and tap it firmly several times on a paper towel or paper plate to dislodge the caked, used grinds. A quick rinse of the basket and cup under the faucet, and you're ready to go again. I own a couple of fairly high-end grinders and a top-of-the-line electric drip coffee maker, as well as various pour-over and steeping brewers, but this little Cuisinart has replaced them as my daily coffee setup. Highly recommended.",PupDaddy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de marzo de 2024
Disappointed but has some good qualities,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",I didn't like the fact that it leaves a mess every time you use the grinder. I submitted a picture that is of one pod after using the grinder. The water reservoir is in the back so you have to move it forward each time you need to fill it. I didn't like how the coffee turned out. I used Starbucks medium blend (same as my pods but it turned out weaker). I do love the concept of having the ability to do either the pods or grind the beans. And that it is compact. It came with an extra pod which is nice also. This one is not for me but you may like it especially if you have a small kitchen. Just too messy for me and weaker coffee,Olentangy Mom,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de enero de 2024
"Pros, but mostly cons","4,0 de 5 estrellas","After 5 months, revisiting my review…

Pro: Makes great tasting coffee from freshly ground beans.

Con: (1) There’s a lot of maintenance involved. In short, each cup creates a mess. The grinding process leaves grounds on the countertop and coffee maker. It seems like there might be a better way to secure the pod, so that there is less spillage; (2) Water does not always flow through the filter well, and the overflow runs down the side of the filter and coffee pod holder.

Overall: I love the concept and the great tasting coffee, but I have ultimately given up on this product. It’s simply not worth the mess and trouble. Cuisinart needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.",UGA_JD,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de enero de 2024
Best when used with paper filters,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","It took me a few days to find the best grind and brew experience. I'm not a fan of metal filters and prefer paper single cup filters for clean up and no slug in the bottom of my coffee cup. The canFly Compatible for K-Carafe 4-CUP Reusable Coffee Filter Premium Disposable Paper Filters (Unbleached 100) work great.

For me, I prefer to stop the grind with about 1/4 inch yet to fill (the grind button can be pushed to start and stop the grind as needed - so I let it grind for a bit, stop it, check it, then grind again until the cup has about 1/4 left to fill).

Another tip: after putting the paper filter into the metal filter, I only put the metal filter under the grinder (I don't put the metal filter into the gray plastic case).

After a few tries, I am now able to grind and brew a cup of coffee without any ground coffee on my countertop.

The first coffeemaker that came didn't work: it would turn on and I could grind beans, but the coffee sizes lights never lit up and didn't do anything. Sent it back for a return. The second coffeemaker did the same thing. I called Cuisinart and they said to unplug the device and leave the coffee pod insert lever completely up. I let it sit for an hour like that, then with the lever still up, I plugged it in and it started working as expected. No issues for the past few weeks.

The space to insert a cup in a bit small for me. Keurig has a generous space for different size mugs and travel mugs, but I can't fit my large Yeti, but it's not a deal breaker.

I also found that the 8oz, 10oz, and 12oz cup sizes were all off by 2oz. 8oz button = 10oz of coffee, etc. So my favorite coffee cups fill almost to the top when I push the 8oz button. Again, not a deal breaker, but a bit of a surprise. I prefer the 8oz amount as I like my coffee a bit on the strong side.

Having used various Keurig machines over the years, and the full-size coffee pot with a separate grinder, this machine is really an excellent solution for me. I usually only need one cup of coffee in the morning, so I can grind the beans, insert the filter in the pod, and brew a cup of coffee in about 2 minutes. The paper filter makes clean up quick and easy and I'm good to go.",Tom,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de septiembre de 2022

A unique concept to avoid Hipster guilt!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This Coffee Maker + Coffee Grinder meets my needs and does what it claims. It's pretty and elegant and requires a small footprint. As a niche device there are some minor deficiencies. But I stand by my 5 rating because no coffee machine can be perfect. Like a lover, sometimes we have to adjust our expectations to have a healthy happy relationship, especially at 6 AM.

Convenience: Grinding and brewing a hot cup of joe is easy and fast! No separate coffee grinder or mess required. It provides the convenience of a K-cup brewer without the modern guilt of creating landfill waste. If you happen to be short of beans, just remember that emergency stash of Costco K-cups you keep out-of-site from you lover and friends.

Need to Know: Buy extra reusable coffee filter cups. Yeah, yeah, yeah... You're buying more plastic... More angst! But you still take your own bags to the grocery store, don't you?! It's much easier to clean several of them together once coffee time is done, rather than while half awake after your first cup. But wash your cups before bedtime! You'll be pissed if you have to wash them at 6 AM in a pre-caffeine stupor.
Compatible cups are sold cheaply all over Amazon.

Tip for Stronger Coffee: After grinding, tap the filter cup on the cabinet a few times, put it back on the grinder, grind four seconds more, tap again and brew. Don't put so much coffee that you have to force the lid closed.

Small Gripes: The water reservoir is bit small. This would be an easy fix for Cuisinart on future generations of this product. The process is a bit messier that my old Keurig (but not bad).",BK,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de diciembre de 2023
Bean coffee by the cup!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I was looking for a machine that would brew a single cup from a built-in bean grinder and found this. It works well and after a few cups all residue taste is gone and every cup is what I expect. It also uses traditional k-cup style pods. My only complaint is that you you cannot select a cup size (8, 10, 12) when grinding beans. When you touch the grind button it will fill the pod to the top (equaling a 12oz cup’s worth) with coffee grinds.

Nice coffee maker,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I like this coffee maker very much! I bought 2 of them!! 1 for the camper and 1 for the house. I am thinking of getting another one for work. The only problem I have is that it leaves a thick fine mud at the bottom of the cup!! If it had a paper filter to go with the micro mesh filter, I think it would be better!! I tried the original K-Cups in it, and it just didn't work right?? Don't know why or if the K-cups were just bad or what?? It made a mess with it, and I didn't like cleaning it out. Not fun. Tried other k-cups and happened to do the same thing. Don't know if it can grind finer or not but would like to see a setting on the grinder for that thing otherwise I love this coffee maker!!",Vicker H,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de octubre de 2023
Ideal for single coffee drinker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I’ve been on the lookout for a single serving coffee maker that doesn’t take up much counter space, and can use both grounds and pods. Cuisinart hit all the marks, with a bonus bean grinder. The machine is intuitively easy to use. Clean up is simple. It doesn’t take up too much counter space. I’m the only coffee drinker in my household, so the typical pitcher style drip coffee is just too big. With this machine, I get a fresh hot cup each time. The carafe is large enough to last me a couple days. The coffee is smooth and needs no paper filter. Temperature is perfectly hot without scalding my tongue. I love the versatility of coffee making options. And the pod-holder (which I haven’t used) stores away neatly in a hidden compartment along the left side.

The only improvement would be having some cute color options, but the black and steel match my oven so I can’t really complain. I purchased this on sale for roughly $105. Well worth the value. With Cuisinart, I am hoping this lasts many years of daily use.",cav0011,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de marzo de 2024
Terrorized by the grinder,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","There are no controls on the grinder. I’ve been using this single cup maker about 2 months. I bought it because I thought it would be less messy than my mueller 10 cup pot and blade grinder. It is not! First you need paper filters to easily dispose of the grinds so they don’t clog up a garbage disposal. The only filters available are the tall (oversized) ones in the photo. The grinder leaves grinds on the back rim of the mesh filter whether you have a paper in it or not. There is a box below the steel rack that over time collects the grinds, as you see in the photo. You cannot lift the grinder to be able to slide out the filter after the coffee is ground into it so that the mountain of grounds doesn’t make a mess. You can see in the photo where it’s messy at the back rim and in the other photo where I tamped the grinds down with my finger. The grinder goes for about 18 or 19 seconds so this is what I do. I grind for a count of 4 or 5 elephants, then press the power on/off button. Then I slide out the filter cup and tamp down those grinds. And do that again. When you put the paper filter in you have to mush it in like a pie crust. Make sure the lip side that gathers the most paper is NOT sitting at the back end where you grind, and is not at the front end where you latch the plastic holder. If that plastic top gets cantankerous and won’t click shut just push down the machine lid. You need a paper filter unless you like a lot of sludge and don’t worry about coffee grinds clogging your house drainage.",Neo,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de diciembre de 2022
Nice little coffee maker with good and not so great features,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",This is a nice coffee maker. It has a small footprint and looks nice. You have the ability to use K-Cups along with coffee beans of your choice giving you a far greater variety. The unit is quiet and well designed. Having the bean option will save money over the K-Cups and of course produce less waste. I only have to negative points here and both are with the grinder. 1) It overfills and spills grinds on the tray. 2) The grinds could be finer. An adjustment to fine tune both of these would make this unit phenomenal. But for this price you are still getting more than your moneys worth.,Edward Luczak,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de diciembre de 2023
Amazing cup of coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","so usually I am a Nespresso girl and my husband is a Keurig king. lol I ran of of pods and had to have a k cup of coffee and it was horrible, beyond watered down and not what I needed to start my day. our old Keurig machine was about 6 years old so when Christmas came I decided to get him a new one. I love the smell of fresh ground coffee so I was intrigued to buy this one. my only concern was how annoying it would be to actually use, and if it was as easy as popping in a pod. and IT IS! they make it super easy with the push of a button into a little pod and boom fresh cup of coffee! I have actually not bought Nespresso pods since! and to switch off from fresh coffee or a pod is super easy as well just switch the insert!

"Freshest coffee I've ever had, at home!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","The Cuisinart Single Serve Bean to Cup Coffee Maker is fantastic. You first put a few spoons of your favorite coffee beans into the grinder. I also pop a small paper filter into the reusable filter container (less mess and extra filtered). Hit the grind button and it fills up your filter container in about 10 seconds. Pop that out, close it's lid, put that container into the coffee maker on right and close the lid. Then hit your water preference, I use the 8 ounce button which seems to dispense more than that. Done. Add your creamer or whatever you like and you are set to go. It takes about 2 or 2:30 min total. It's so great using whole beans, grinding it and putting it directly into the machine. You also have the option to fill the reusable filter container with ground coffee, or you can use K-Cups. However, I'm sticking to whole beans and grinding them right here in my kitchen from now on. The Machine is also compact, looks nice and is easy to use and easy to clean.

I do love this machine,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I really do love this coffee maker. Fresh grounds and single serve. It works great. The reason for the four star is that when I grind into the pod, the grounds go all over the counter and when I pull the K cup out to brew, coffee grounds fall to the silver bottom.
I found a way around it going all over the counter. I hold the pod up to the bean hopper while it’s doing its grinding. Counter clean!!

Better than the Keurig it replaced,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",I bought this to replace a Keurig that died after just a couple years and I already like it much better. The reservoir for beans makes it look nicer when sitting on the counter and taste fresher. I was a bit worried at first that the grinder would end up making a mess but 99% of the grounds end up in the cup.

"Efficient, cost-effective, easy to use","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I have had this coffee-maker now for nearly a month and am generally pleased. The bean-grinder works as advertised; it's a lot easier than using a separate grinder for beans. The only downside of the grinder is that it's a bit of a pain to clean. As for the coffee itself, we've had to adjust to a slightly different taste than we had with our older Keurig model (using the same coffee), but it's fine. The only downside is that the water reservoir is quite a bit smaller than we're used two. We have to fill it before every use (wife and I each drink two cups every morning).

Good Coffee Maker for the price but it's not perfect,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Alright. I've had this coffee maker for about a year and use it almost daily.

Pros
-Get to grind the beans yourself.
-Makes single serve portions.
-Easy to clean up since it's a relatively simple machine.

Cons
-Loud grinder
-Water tank sometimes leaks
-The grinder overfills the pod, so you get excess ground coffee beans everywhere.

This machine isn't perfect but if you're wanting a machine that'll grind your beans and make you single portion coffee all on a budget, then this is a great machine for that.

But if you could afford the $300+ options that are out there I'm sure those would be better.",Anonymous,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de septiembre de 2023
Great for coffee lovers,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I really like strong coffee with great flavor but hate paying for the big brand K cups not to mention feeling guity about all the little plastice cups left over. This is really great. I will say I am the only coffee drinker in my house so only having one basket for grounds isn't as inconvenient as it would for several cups brewed in a row. Do say I would love to have more than one for purchase. Would buy again

Updated review in 10/23
Not sure Id buy again. The add water button will stick on and not reset no matter what I do. And will do even if it still has water in the tank. You will always need to make sure there is plenty of water in the tank. Unplugging. Shaking. Nothing will reset and therefore will not brew anything. Sometimes you just forget to check. When this dies or I get annoyed enough I'll not replace with same.

Update review 2/24
It's going to go away as soon as I can go buy another, real, Kuerig. I've had Keurigs in the past but fell in love with the idea of being able to grind my own beans. It is, as others complained, very messy. The ""add water"" lite comes on and will not reset unless you bang inside the water chanber with a spoon. The amount of coffee dispensed is always anybody's guess. Lastly, after drinking coffee from a Keurig at neighbors, there is a big difference in the coffee. This tightwad is replacing with the real deal.",b in n texas,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de abril de 2022

I've had that happen but I tap the container before pulling out to settle the grounds down. Other reviews about the coffee not being hot enough...I experienced that when I filled the tank with cold water or used cold creamer.

Takes some practice.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I am a 1 cup a day coffee drinker. Just received coffee maker. Thanks to reviews I read, I was able to use. Grinder worked right off the bat but cup sizes didn’t light up. So I left it plugged in with the lever up and made a cup with my Keurig. Just as I sat down to drink my coffee, I heard a beep. When I put lever down cup sizes lit up and it worked. I used paper disposable filter and watched as I filled coffee from grinder and shut off when a little from the top. At first I didn’t align the pod as indicated and it dripped from 3 places. Operator error. When aligned it drips from single stream. It made a 8 ounce cup with that button and coffee was good.

"Works well, quick and convenient.","5,0 de 5 estrellas","Works very nicely. The grinder does not scatter grounds all over, unlike the reviews of some of the higher prices competing models. You can tell some though went into small details of the design. The drip pan has a hole in it, so drips go down and are caught by the underside of the drip plate, rather than hitting it and splashing. There is a pop-out drawer which holds the k-cup insert when you are using the refillable filter, or the refillable filter when you are using.the k-cup. Would be nice if there was somewhere to hold the scoop/push attachment, but it's not that big of a deal. Grinds and makes a single cup of coffee much quicker than making a pot of coffee. If you were making lots of coffee it would of be slower, but of course that's not the intent for any of these single serve coffee makers.",Katarn,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de diciembre de 2023
Messy - Waste of money !,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","From the first use, (used only twice) brew drips all over the place! Does not come down in a straight line. Made sure no clogged holes, but still messy dripping. Eventually had to call their customer service, because the online customer service area said ""Not available"". After waiting for a long time, a customer service guy asked for the model number AND the serial number!! Gave him the serial number, but he said he can't help unless he has the model number too! Well, that number in apparently ON THE BOTTOM of the machine ! I have the water reservoir full of water, and would have to maybe take that off, empty the bean holder which has beans in it, and all the other removable parts in order to turn over the machine ! I was so angry I told him to forget it, and that the machine is a piece of junk, and hung up !! Bottom line I do NOT recommend this machine, and their customer service is useless. Mind you, I had already done the online product registration too. I am too angry to go through all that's needed to get to the model number. If they knew that number would be required, why didn't they put it on the back of the machine??? Guess, serial number and model number are very different. On the user manual, it has the Series number on it, but they need more. I think they put that other number on the bottom, hoping to discourage us from ever trying to get any kind of service !

Coffee maker would not work,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","During the past 2 weeks we have purchased 5 Grind and Brew Single coffee makers, 2 from our local Bed Bath and Beyond and 2 from Kohls (on line) and one through Amazon. NONE of the units arrived operational. They all had the same problem. We followed the initial setup instructions exactly as shows in the instructions manual. When the power button was pushed, the power came on BUT the 6, 8, and 12oz selection button would not. The grinder worked,,,, but you could not select a brew option. When we took each of the three units back to Bed Bath and Beyond, the very helpful manage tried to get the units to work, no success. The last unit we return, another customer was in front of us returning the same unit because of the same issue. It was her second unit. She had an earlier version of the same unit and LOVED it. The manager could only assume there was a batch problem with the mother board. With that as a possibility, we tried ordering from a different store hoping perhaps they would be from a different batch and perhaps have different results. They still would not power the brew buttons. I am taking these back tomorrow. We still want this coffeemaker-- but we do not know where to get one that will work. I am puzzled this problem exists because in each coffeemaker, there is a slip of paper stating ""This"" coffeemaker was tasted with coffee at the factory.

Returned after first try,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Returned it next day after receiving.
I wasted some good expensive dark coffee beans to make two cups of coffee, which usually produce pretty strong coffee flavor.
1. I made first cup 8 oz, and second - 10 oz. In both cases, basically almost don't have coffee flavor, very watery, and color is light brown. For comparison, I made cup of instant coffee from Trader Joe's, and that was much-much pronounced flavor. I was doing everything by manual - filtered water, quality beans.
2. The so call ""coffee"" liquid came to my cup not hot, and one of the reason, I think, it's the stream coming to the cup, is pretty weak, so it's cooling while it's reaching the cup. Also, I believe, water temperature isn't hot enough when it going through the filter with ground coffee.
3. The ground coffee coming from the grinder is coarse grinding, that probably one of the reason of very weak flavor. They're no grinding adjustment.
4. When I was preparing the machine for returning, it took me considerable amount of time to clean it up - after making, literally, only two cups of coffee, the ground coffee get almost everywhere in the ""wet"" part of the machine, so it takes some effort to clean it up.

Thin coffee and a waste of coffee beans,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I don't typically write product reviews, and hate leaving one like this. However, if you are looking for an all-in-one bean grinder and drip coffee maker that does one cup at a time, do NOT buy this product.

The same volume of beans are ground to fill the filter cup irrespective of how much, or how strong, you want your coffee. You cannot adjust the fineness / coarseness of the grind. Most grinds make it into the filter cup, but the process nevertheless leaves grinds all over your counter. Because the unit is also designed to accommodate single-serve coffee capsules (e.g., k-cups), the water is poured through your fresh grounds in a tight stream that quickly drills a hole through the grounds, such that there is no opportunity for steeping and half of your cup will be filled by near-clear water, not brewed coffee. And after all of that, the process still leaves a thick layer of silt at the bottom of each cup.

Bottom line: if you want a coffee maker that uses pre-packaged, single-serve pods, this might work. If you want a cup of coffee brewed with freshly ground beans, find another solution.",Marianne Leedy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de octubre de 2022

Yes, the grinder has no adjustments available - so you always get coarse ground beans which resulted in weak coffee if you chose a medium or large cup option. If you choose the small 8 oz option it's better. But then you have to go through the process twice to get a full cup of strong coffee. This machine lasted a whole 5 months before it quit working. Like absolutely won't make a cup of coffee at all. So I sit here with my trusty old pour-over waiting for the kettle to boil. No return available to me and $150 gone.

HOW DO YOU TEST SOMETHING AND SEND IT OUT BROKEN. Mistakes happen...so how on earth did I receive a second machine where a completely different component was broken.

Just wow. If you're reading this, don't buy it. You're going to have to deal with return processes and going to your UPS store to ship multiple boxes because you received a faulty product. At that point take yourself to your local walmart and just buy something there. At least if you have to return it, it's a far easier process. Beats not having a working coffee maker for a month.

Garbage,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Like other reviewers received and followed directions and brew lights did not come on. Thought I'd done something wrong tried everything, no brew lights.

I have multiple Cuisinart products so I thought this was a safe bet. Apparently Cuisinart is aware of this common of defect and don't care. Amazon should stop selling this product all together. Should have read the reviews before I spent so much time on hold with Cuisinart customer service. This brand is going downhill fast but don't care about their reputation apparently.
Amazon please do something about this so more customers don't get taken in.

DONT BUY THIS MACHINE,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This is exactly what I was looking for and was so excited to get this coffee maker.

So bummed and tried all the reset tricks and it didnt work. I than called Cuisinart. Lol. What a joke. They didnt want to help and just told me to return it. They made it sound like it's Amazon's problem and took zero accountability for the POS they were sending out. I really wanted this machine so I ordered another one. It just came in and the exact same problem. DONE!!! Cuisinart's defective rate has to be massive on this machine.

Just doesn’t work right…,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",This unit seemed like the absolutely perfect compromise. You could do KCups and grind your own coffee into single serve cups with a built in grinder. For the first two weeks it worked fine. Then K-Cups started essentially spitting grounds everywhere (see picture) and it happens every time. Ok…I could still grind beans directly into the single serve. Well…three months in and now unless you hold down the pod door it will not brew. Three months and this awesome looking machine with so much promise is basically worthless (the grinder still works…for now). Money down the drain and I need to replace it with something that works since I use it most days of the week. So disappointed!!!,B. Baldwin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de noviembre de 2023
Terrible,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee maker is awful. Do not buy it. I thought it would be nice to have an option to grind my own k cup coffee, or use pods on the same machine. It isn’t. First of all you have to practically slam the lid down on the pods to make it brew. Then it only gives you 4 ounces which isn’t even an option. You push the button for 8 ounces and it only halfway fills. It took me three times to get an actual full cup of coffee. And, now the pods are starting to explode.

About 2 minutes for a 12 ounce cup. this is much longer than other coffee makers I have owned. It also does leave grounds on the tray after grinding. Not a deal breaker for me as my stand alone grinder would leave grounds on the counter. I also wish it had a larger water tank. I drink a lot of coffee and find myself filling it a couple times a day.

When grinding, it would get grounds all over and was a mess to clean up. It made enough of a mess that it wasn't worth using.

Very weak and watery coffee,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Very disappointed in the quality of the coffee. It is weak and watery. Even with brand new, high-quality, dark, oily beans, the coffee was weak, and that's on the 8 oz setting (which actually gives you about 10 oz of coffee). It's even more watery on the 10 and 12 oz settings.

I called Cuisinart for help, but they only had two suggestions: don't overfill the hopper so the beans can grind more easily, and buy fresh, dark beans. I'd already tried both of those things, so they were no help. Also, the customer support person didn't know anything about this machine and kept asking me which grind setting I was using. It took a bit of back and forth before I could convince them that there's only one, default setting. They then left me on hold for quite a while they read the manual.

Issues that create watery coffee:
--The machine only has one grind setting, which they claim is medium, but seems more coarse than medium to me. It's hard to get strong, flavorful coffee with coarse grounds.
--The water runs through the grounds too quickly, so the flavor doesn't have time to bloom and develop.

On the other hand, I love virtually everything else about this coffee maker, which is why I gave it 2 stars. If you prefer your coffee weak, you might love this machine.

Pros:
--Looks good
--Doesn't take up too much counter space
--Easy to use
--Very easy to clean
--Very convenient to have a grinder and a coffee maker in one product
--Good-sized bean hopper and water reservoir means you only have to refill occasionally, so it's fast and easy to make a cup of coffee.

The filter basket was tricky to find. There's a door in the side of the machine that holds it. Look closely because the door blends in and is hard to see.

"Great Concept, Poor Execution...","2,0 de 5 estrellas","The concept of fresh ground beans used to make a single cup of coffee is awesome, however, unlike other full pot bean grind inclusive Cuisinart products I have purchased, this one is poorly lacking. So disappointing. The bean grinding process is a bit messy, easily remedied by placing a paper towel under the grinder side. Inconvenient, but willing to deal with a bit of clean up from grounds coming out around the coffee maker and in the tray below, for the sake of good coffee! Unfortunately, doesn't happen, the coffee on any of the settings using dark roast Lavazza and Starbucks, two great candidates for strong coffee, is weak and flavorless due to not enough coffee product to drip through.

There are several issues that would make us not buy it again and we’re sorry we missed the return window. I’ll start by saying the K-cup function works fine. The grinder is super loud and could easily wake up the household. It also overfills the cup it goes into and leaves a mess on the tray. Many times the beans get wonky in the hopper and it doesn’t grind at all. We have to find a chopsticks and give the beans a swirl. The yucky part is that there’s always a pile of sludge in the bottom of the coffee cup so you have to be careful of not finishing the cup. If there is more than one person using the maker it’s probably best to get the carafe.

This coffee maker was a real step down from the high quality one I had, and you can definitely tell. The coffee flavor is disgusting for the same amazing coffee ground in a higher quality machine. This is no more than an over priced hot water dispenser that turns good quality coffee int cheap gas station paper cup quality coffee. It is a total let down.

Makes a mess with every cup.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I expect better products from Cuisinart. However, this is the second coffee maker I have purchased from Cuisinart, and both have been very disappointing. The first one was a small regular drip pot, which didn't keep it hot, leaked with every use. This new coffee maker has some design flaws. I wanted a self contained maker that is able to grind coffee beans and brew coffee in a completely enclosed system. I couldn't find one like that that I could afford ($300 +). The primary problem with this maker is every time it grinds coffee, grounds spill out. The capsule is filled up and has to be moved to another part of the maker. When I take the capsule out, it is too full and more grounds spill out. This is so annoying. Plus, it goes through A LOT of coffee beans. Which is getting more and more expensive. It's just not well designed. I would have returned it but I kept thinking I would figure out how to use it without the mess, but nothing has worked.

Unfortunately, this coffee maker did not deliver. The grinder grinds too many beans than can fit in the grounds cup so you end up spilling grounds all over the place and having to remove some from the top. In addition to that, while pouring the coffee the spout will sometimes bubble or spurt grounds.

We really wanted to like this coffee maker but it's hard to ignore its flaws.",A Reel Cheap Muse,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de enero de 2024
Really Bad Design,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Sometimes I wonder if product designers test the design …

Example - the coffee maker can make a 12 ounce cup of coffee but most travel mugs don’t fit under the spout - there’s no enough clearance.

Not even a large coffee cup works with the 12 oz pour setting - it overflows

Also, the spout is not centered so depending on the cup style you have to make sure it’s centered",steve schwaid,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de enero de 2024

NOT WORTH BUYING!,"2,0 de 5 estrellas",I bought this in hopes to have fresh ground coffee everyday. The system is easy enough to use but requires several steps to get to end result and is very messy. First you put the filter and holder under the grinding side. There's only one choice of ground consistency and amount. When it's done grinding a very coarse ground (the only type it does) you remove the grounds holder and when you do the grinder drops about a tablespoon of grinds on the stand causes a mess. So I've had to put a small cup underneath to catch the extra grounds. Then you place the grounds holder in the side that makes the coffee. Since it makes the holder too full of grounds they end up in the brewing area....There must be an easier way! Think I'll go back to grinding my beans then placing them in a holder myself....Would not recommend.,Lynn Scheirer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de diciembre de 2022
Poor customer service,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","We purchased this coffee maker on July 6 and it was delivered on the 7th. Good start. Near the end of August the machine began dispensing the wrong amount of water ( only three choices ) while using pods. We tried it several more times and each was incorrect. It was past the Amazon return date by two weeks. We called Cusinart customer service and felt like we were given the runaround. We accommodated them by running vinegar through the machine. ( quite a process after less than 45 cups of coffee ) still did not fix problem. They reluctantly said that they would send out a new unit. On 9/6/22 they took the order. On 9/14/22 they packaged the order and on 9/20/22 we received it. To make matters worse it is now selling for 30$ less than we paid. We will never buy another Cusinart even though our previous Kuerig Cusinart pod coffee maker lasted 10 yrs.

Suffers serious design flaws,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Updated review:
I ended up returning this because of the mess factor and the water leak was not worth the hassle. Also my wife complained about the ground coffee being to weak. So I bought a grinder with 14 different grind settings and went back to the old Keurig . Happy wife happy life.
_______________________________________________________________________

The machine make an ok cup of coffee but suffers from a couple of design flaws.
1) the grinder spews coffee grinds on the counter when ever it grinds beans and overfills the basket so when you slide the basket out it spreads more grinds on the counter. Both of these issues could have been easily corrected during design if they would have better inclosed the grinder area and set the grind capacity just a little bit less.
2) The unit leaks water out the bottom onto the counter and it was nor over filled. Most other makers return water to the water storage. The real issue with this is if you have Granite counters and it leaks bit not enough that it is visible outside the foot print of the maker when you move it to clean the granite is discolored. Thankfully design flaw one above ensures that the coffee machine is moved frequently to clean up the grounds.
We are seriously considering returning it but can't find another coffee grinder/maker that supports K-Cups too.

The old saying hold true on this one, ""Let the buyer beware""",GM Tampa,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de julio de 2022
I would give it a C,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Great idea with some very basic design flaws that are a no-brainer.
First the coffee quality is OK. Not bad, not great. The fact that you can't adjust the strength of the coffee brew at all (that I can find). The brew is weak. If you like strong coffee I think you will be disappointed.

Adding beans into the hopper is easy enough - but why not make the top a little wider instead of just barely able to squeeze some beans next to the grinder. Just a very easily avoidable design flaw IMO.

Unless you have a very small travel it doesn't even come close to fitting. I'm not talking about the monster Yeti ones or anything like that. I'm talking about the standard ones you buy in target or get a a trade show. the ones that are EVERYWHERE ... I have no idea how they thought that was a good design. Terrible, you basically have to brew in something else and then pour into your standard sized travel mug. Poor design.

I'm on the fence at this point. I hate the K cups as an everyday coffee which is what led me to this but it's a pretty big miss on some of the very very basic features.",Leo,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de octubre de 2022
Messy,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Nice idea but a lot of work for a single cup of coffee!!! Grounds go everywhere when grinding! Must empty, clean, and dry and clean up grinds after every cup of coffee!

The item is compact and is stylish- it looks decent on my counter top. I like the water tank being hidden in the back - the 3 different OZ sizes of coffee is nice.

Now the grinder does the job- probably won't have the most important functions of the appliance. However the biggest issues is it makes a damm mess with every brew.

Quick coffee with annoyances,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","The machine leaks water even if you don't move it around. The water filter slides in only without any click or retention so it's easily dislodged when refilling.

The grinder is quiet and makes the right amount but its messy and grinds get everywhere. Filling the bean hopper is tedious as the motor and housing is right in the middle so beans end up bouncing out onto the floor or counter.

The side storage bin is nice but it's only designed for the portafilter. The door doesn't fully close if you store the pod piercer.

It does brew quickly and at a good temperature. It just has too many shortcomings for me to want to deal with.",HumanWiki,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de diciembre de 2023

I have yet to find any “k cup” style brewing method that makes strong and hot coffee. This machine is no exception. The temperature of the coffee is slightly low and you really need to preheat your cup with hot water before brewing.

Solid Coffee Maker For K-Cups But Just Okay For Ground Reusable Cups,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I got this coffee maker to be less wasteful with K-cups, and to that end the coffee maker is great. I like that it grinds right into the provided reusable K-cup, and the coffee is pretty good when made on the 8 oz setting.

The cons are the grinder overflows the reusable K-cup every time, so I'm constantly cleaning ground beans. Also, the 10 oz & 12 oz settings make the coffee too watery for me. This is the case for normal prepackaged K-cups and the reusable K-cup. Lastly, the removable floor where you place your coffee cup is so thin. I'm always worried about my cup falling off, because none of them sit fully on it. I guess I could remove it, but it's still not a flat surface. That's super nitpicky, but I'll never have a cup there while it's grinding for fear it'll fall off. Just a weirdly overlooked design flaw.

All in all, this is a good but not great coffee maker to get off of wasteful K-cups, and not wanting to make the potted drip coffee every morning.",Kyle Jones,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de octubre de 2022

My only criticisms is that the bean container is too small and nees constaant refilling (I only have 1 -2 cups a day) and the gold filter baskets which fits inside their ""barista"" cassette are not available as additinal accessories. This is important as you must wash the basket every time you use it before you can make another cup.

"Not as good or convenient as a Keurig, but way less expensive per cup","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Instructions are a little vague, but you can figure it out. This is nothing more than a drip coffee maker, single cup, with a grinder. You have to transfer the filter cup from under the grinder to the drip side and then wash it out when the process is finished. Definitely not as efficient nor as neat as a Keurig, but much less expensive as you are using your favorite coffee beans rather than purchasing their pods. The coffee tastes the same as if it were made in a drip coffee maker. It does not have that Keurig taste, which is more like instant coffee (but better) in my opinion.

I would NOT recommend using kcups, I've tried several times when I've run out of beans and I have always gotten a cup of goopy grinds, and nasty ground-filled overflow in a lot of hard to reach places (the photos in this review).

It also allows you to use K-cups, if so inclined. It grinds a full single basket each time, filled to the top of fresh coffee grinds. The only downside I have encountered is that since it grinds a single full basket, there is no way to vary the strength of brew, especially since it has buttons for 8, 12, and 16 ounce cups/mugs.

For anyone who said it’s watery, may be using the 12 ounce and weaker flavor brand.
I also love that it will fit a regular k-cup for guests who may have a different favorite brand.

I have been using mine for about 6 months and the grinder is already starting to go out.

Nice all in 1,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",Biggest complaint I read before I purchased was the weak brew. That can be true. I like robust coffee so I buy the French Roast dark. However even with strong coffee beans you still have to brew only an eight ounce cup otherwise it can be too weak for me. Love the fact you can grind and brew on the same machine. The grinder is noisy so keep that in mind. Can’t change the grind size so that is a negative but other than that pretty good machine.

I always felt like it was a hassle to make my own pot of coffee for 1 cup. I never wanted to buy a keurig machine because of how terrible for the environment the k cups are. This machine with the reusable k cup is AMAZING! The fact that you can grind your own coffee into the k cup is exatly what I wanted. It smells amazing when it's being ground and brewing. It's extremely easy to use. The only downside is that it is loud to grind the coffee but it's the same sound as a regular coffee grinder so that's expected. It does make a little bit of a mess, let's some small amount of coffee out of the sides but it gets caught by the removable plate at the bottom for super easy clean up so that's not a problem in my opinion. I had no problems with strength of coffee. It was very strong when I made an 8oz cup. It also made exactly 8oz of coffee (I used a measuring cup to check). This is a dream coffee machine for me! It does so much in such a small space. Definitely recommend!",Amanda,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de marzo de 2022
"Bought this for a coffee addict, she loves it! Not fully automated grinding though","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this for my mom as a sort of catch all since she loves ground coffee, but may want to try new kinds of K cups every once in a while. She loves it and appreciates how compact it is in her new apartment. It’s also the ease and consistency that it brews which is a big win. She can use coffee beans of her choice and get the same flavor every time. The main goal was to make it easy and consistent, which this does perfectly!

I had thought it would be much like some of their other offerings that grind and then directly brew the coffee, but as it turns out although it can do grinding, regular grounds, and K-Cups, the grinding to brewing process does require you to move the ground material to Another part of the machine by hand. It does not go straight from grinding to brewing. Not a huge deal, mind you. Certainly not a dealbreaker for my mom. But The description makes it seem like a single push button affair when it’s a bit more like a two-step deal.",Daniel R. Shaw,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de agosto de 2022
Perfect for our two person household,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My girlfriend is a coffee fiend, and I bought this for her for Christmas. It's been FANTASTIC. She uses it every day (as do I). The grinder is fantastic, allowing us to get more out of the whole bean bags since it grinds one cup at a time. Cleaning takes about 30 seconds after each use: dump the grinds in the trash, wash out the holder, and you're back to it. It doesn't take up much counter space, either. Really a perfect set-up!",Brad King,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de febrero de 2024
"Fresh ground = more effort, better taste.","5,0 de 5 estrellas","This machine gives the option of using pre-packaged pods, self-filled reusable pods, or fresh ground. For ease of use, ease of clean up; go with pre-packaged pods. For a better tasting cup of coffee go with fresh ground. This machine is slower than my dedicated pod machine. If you use self-filled pods; it requires greater maintenance, even more for fresh ground. The versatility is helpful. IMO an excellent cup of coffee (fresh ground).",Dann,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de febrero de 2024
WOW!!!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I was excited to get this coffee maker. It does everything as described. I was most interested in the single serve grind and brew. What a difference the grind makes! I have also used pre-ground coffee and pods. It does a great job with each of these features. I have not had an issue with grounds making a mess. I’ve had a few ground fall on the tray but I just brush them into the tray until I clean it. The only thing I am not crazy about is the narrow opening to add the beans. Overall, I give it 👍🏻👍🏻!!!!!!!",Karen K. Immel,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de diciembre de 2023
Makes very good coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",The only thing that I didn’t like was the small amount of coffee grounds that comes through the reusable coffee filter when the coffee is ground. This problem can be solved by placing a small shallow “Dollar Store” bowl under the filter cup holder. Another solution is to use paper coffee filters made for “K-Carafe” filter cups. which also fit the Cuisinart filter cups. No ground coffee comes through these filters. Using paper filters also eliminates the need to empty and clean the reusable filter.,Robert,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de enero de 2024
3 months later,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We have had this coffee maker for 3 months. We make 4-5 cups a day. Bought it at a good discount at the time, less than what I see it for now.

This was a good purchase.",James,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de marzo de 2024
Love it!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee machine is wonderful! I've not experienced any problems with messiness or loose, muddy coffee grounds at all. Make sure to use the cup with the filter!

Pretty good value,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have a love, hate, mostly love relationship with this machine after several days of use. I love the options it gives me: ground coffee, whole bean coffee, K- cups. I don’t love that its filter is less than perfect. There are grounds in the bottom of every cup of coffee I make. The grind mechanism not only grinds coffee into the receptacle but also leaves some on the stand after I remove the receptacle. All this is fairly easy to clean up. This machine replaces a more expensive machine that I accidentally broke. It’s not as good as that machine (it is after all much cheaper) but it is better than my old Keurig machine.",pems-integ-tests,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de septiembre de 2023
Works great!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",I was skeptical of this coffee machine because of the reviews but this thing is great! I haven’t had any issues other than it can be a tad messy after the coffee grounds have been grounded but nothing I can’t quickly wipe up. If that doesn’t bother you I highly recommend.,Trevor Rogers,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de marzo de 2024
Great tasting coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",Just got this and have used for a few days and I am amazed at how much better the coffee is than a K cup. And I'm only using the Amazon beans. I hope this thing lasts because its great so far.

"Hands down, the best coffee maker we’ve ever had.","5,0 de 5 estrellas","We’ve tried several different single cup makers and after 4 months of use, this one is unquestionably the best one.

I Love this Coffee Maker!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I had used a pod coffee maker for several years but enjoyed grounding my beans for a fresher flavor and made drip coffee when I had time. Our home system broke after 3yrs so I had to decide what to buy next. I went on the hunt because I vaguely recalled seeing a machine that ground and brewed single serve coffee.

I am so glad I searched for it and didn't grab another of the same! It may have taken some work, but it was totally worth the work! I only have one small issue that we've easily made work. We use small Yeti-type 20oz cups because they keep the coffee hot, and we often drink slowly. Since the cups don't fit below the coffee brew area, we use the cup you see in my video, and then pour it into our preferred cup. It also gives me larger size options which allow us to finish quicker.",Michele Brooks,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de abril de 2023
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS COFFEE MAKER!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My husband bought this for me for my birthday a couple months ago, and I love it! I haven't used my regular coffee maker since I received this sweet machine!

It's so awesome that I can grind my fresh beans into it's little filter, then go straight to brewing whatever size coffee that I'm in the mood for. It's so easy to use, and I get a great cup of coffee each time!

I highly recommend this machine!",Cheri Hughes,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de diciembre de 2023
I love this combo coffee maker!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this coffee machine..it’s a great addition to a countertop coffee bar. The machine looks sleek and fancy.. I love the look of the beans. The grinder works great. The ability to make fresh, ground coffee in a pod, or use regular kcups is exactly what I was looking for. It doesn’t take up a ton of space on a countertop, so it is perfect. Highly recommend",Lauren,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de diciembre de 2023
Happy purchase,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My Breville grinf and brew went kaput so I decided to look for another machine that would let me grind. I had a keurig in the past that got moldy and a nespresso that I loved. This combined the good features of everything without the expense. Very easy to use the k cups and also the grinder when I want to use my own beans. The only down side is the water tank doesn't do a true 5 cups between fills but I can handle filling it. I love that it has filters in the water tank...also easy to replace. Do register the product. I had a slight problem at one point, called Cuisinart and they found me in the system. The customer service rep was amazing. Problem easily fixed and she was patient and knowledgeable.",Fredda Bianco,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de abril de 2023

Perfect for what I needed,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I downsized into a 34' 5th wheel trailer, and had to have a coffee maker that fit in the small amount of counter space available. This is perfect. I've used in now for over a month, and had no issues, and it makes great coffee. I love the convenience of K cups, but had the plastic waste left behind. This is ideal, with its reusable coffee grounds holder. You can grind you own beans, or put reground coffee in the dispenser. You have a great deal of control over the strength of your coffee.

I love it, and would recommend it to anyone. If you need something for a small space, even better.",James P. Manning,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de agosto de 2023
Great machine,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I LOVE this coffee maker. I am a one cup a day person and this totally satisfies everything I like about that one cup. I formerly used a French press or an aero press, and it was good coffee, but cumbersome with all the parts. Now I have one appliance that does it all and does it well. My only concession is that the grind is the same for all size cups, and the 8 oz is too strong, so I just brew a 10 oz and I'm happy.",LI Young,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de septiembre de 2023

Love this coffemaker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","After fumbling a little getting started, have found this machine very easy and quick to use. I was expecting the reusable filter cup to rest in the holder under the coffee bean to fit more snugly, but it just slides in and works just fine. You get a few flakes on the drip drain and around the edge of the filter but that is a non-issue and easily dispensed with. Some said the coffee was weak and there were a lot of grounds in the cup. Again, I found it a non-issue. The flavor is fine (we use a dark roast) and the filter screen does allow a few grounds through, but that is an extremely minor inconvenience. Coffee flavor is excellent! We usually just have one cup in the morning, and I usually don't drink any at all. Well, after getting this going for the first time today, I have had three and my Wife two. Outstanding machine! Highly recommend!",Kindle Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de mayo de 2022

This is so much easier than messing with grinding your beans in a separate machine and having that extra mess.

EXCELLENT PRODUCT: But needs a DESIGN ENGINEER to deal with coffee grounds? I have a temporary FIX?,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","First See the Photos above: positioning the lid to open on the CUP side, you can minimize grounds flinging into the cup and cupboard. With the lid in the up position it provides a lift to the basket to bring closer to the top… and minimizes coffee grounds scattered on/in the surrounding area. The second picture shows the minimal coffee grinds with the coffee basket pictured on the side of the cup above. Now I’m not an Engineer but a Design Engineer can adjust the levels and “tighten” the opening Gap between basket top and coffee Maker bottom and still allow Basket to have an easy slide into position!

This is the only one I loved enough to leave a review for. Its literally perfect. For some reason it didn't work for the first 5 minutes or so while I was first setting it up, but ever since then its worked flawlessly. The cleaning of the reusable pod and the refilling of the water and bean hopper take like 30 seconds total. If you have the money and love coffee, I say buy it today. There is a super expensive Barista style espresso machine in the lobby of my apartment building and I still prefer using my cuisineart coffee maker even though its 1 hundredth the cost!",Alex,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de noviembre de 2022
Better than I Expected,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Some of the reviews said it was a great idea but not executed perfectly. I ordered it anyway but expectations weren’t that high.

After using it for the past three weeks, I think it’s a great product. Works fine with normal K-cups, grounds or coffee beans. As long as I’m careful after grinding the beans to make sure no grounds are sitting on the top of the plastic cup, I haven’t had any issues with grounds in the coffee.

I’m really happy with this coffee maker. The coffee tastes much better from beans than the K-cups, probably because it’s fresher, but you always have the option to use grounded coffee or K-cups if you run out of beans.",RBW,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de enero de 2023

"Quiet, convenient, space saving, no environmental waste.","5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a gem. Seriously. No washing a carafe or wasting a half carafe. It pours right into your cup. Make only as much as you can drink : 8-, 10-, or 12-ounce sizes. It comes with a reusable filtered pod. No hit on the environment like the Keurig. However, it is versatile if you really like the pre-made pods. There's a nifty side storage to hold the reusable pod and filter so you don't lose it. The burr grinder is quiet and sounds like quality (compared to my old Mr. Coffee grinder that just died). And it doesn't hog up counter space as would a separate grinder and coffee pot. Such a small footprint, and so pretty. Plus it's Cuisinart, a dependable brand in my view. Total winner. 10/10.",Kamalo Kitty,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de junio de 2022
