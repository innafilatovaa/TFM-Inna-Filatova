Junky Presto Coffee Pot.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Not too much to like about it. It does not have a sight glass to see how much coffee is left in the pot. It does not have the see through percolator lid. The light does not change when it's done brewing. The basket holes are too small and the coffee grounds overflow into the coffee. The lid takes two hands, and is difficult to remove, especially when it is still hot. The handle is very poorly designed, the funky shape makes it unbalanced, and just to make it painful they put square edges on it. The whole thing looks and feels crappy. Finally but not least, the coffee flavor is not good, like it's not completely done.",STEPHEN A STERN,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de junio de 2024
Delicious cup of coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We’ve tried numerous ways of making a “perfect” cup of coffee: French press (mud in bottom), electric drip, instant. (We avoided Kuerig because of the waste, and stopped using drip because of the plastic components.) Our families used to use percolators in the 60’s and 70’s, and the coffee was great; so we decided to try a percolator with all stainless steel parts. The coffee is delicious! We’ve made it with and without filters. Either way, it has a non-bitter, rich taste. The only warning we might have is that the pot is very hot to the touch, but if you use the handle to move it, no problem. Bottom line, we love it. Highly recommended.",Kindle Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de junio de 2024

Loses Heat Over Time,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I did a lot of research and got a few different models while in search of HOT coffee. I ended up getting this and was pleased for about 6 months. Then gradually the coffee got less hot. Still great for the first cup but even after 20 minutes, the temperature dropped and I'd need to nuke it for 30 sec. In retrospect, this is consistent with what others have said about all percolators made today; the heating elements don't last. I just ordered a vintage coffeemaker from the 1970's, when things were built to last longer - hoping for a good hot cup that lasts.

Also, someone in a review originally suggested that since this coffee pot doesn't have automatic shutoff that one get a separate timer that plugs into the wall. This was great suggestion and worked well. Allowed me to regulate how long the coffee maker was on and to be sure that it did not burn out",Michael Dechiara,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de mayo de 2024

Best Coffee Maker I've Used!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used several different kinds of coffee makers, and also often have Starbucks and Wawa coffee. I used to be a ""coffee with your cream/milk"" type of drinker - but the coffee I make with this percolator (using a paper filter) I can almost drink black - it's that good!

I originally bought it after I got a bit paranoid about microplastics - and realized that with most home coffee makers, plastic comes into contact with the hot liquid. In this percolator, only stainless steel touches the liquid - the only plastic is on the outside. The delicious coffee surprised me. Also - you can actually easily clean every part of this coffee maker (unlike most kinds). Sure - it takes a few minutes to prepare and brew compared to drip coffee makers or Keurig, but it's definitely worth it. I'll make a 10-cup for just myself and save the left-over coffee in a glass carafe in the fridge to make iced coffee with (or heat up the next day, depends on what I'm feeling).

Healthy Alternative to French Press,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used and enjoyed a French Press to make coffee for over 25 years. To reduce my rising middle-age cholesterol levels, however, I decided to switch to a classic percolator. (Reliable studies show that coffee that is not filtered through paper contains cafestol and kahweol, which can raise serum levels of ""bad"" cholesterol significantly.)
While this Presto percolator may not produce coffee quite as rich or bold as my French Press, its percolated coffee is definitely hotter and still delicious. I also like almost-instantaneous morning gratification - by setting the percolator up the night before and plugging it in the next morning. It's faster and easier to clean that the French Press and keeps my second cup hotter too. I use the same type filter that came with the coffee. It is a square filter with holes punched to secure the center and the edges so that the coffee grounds are completely encapsulated (not folded on the sides). To empty the pot, I just lift out the ""capsule"" of coffee and gently clean the pot. Easy. Then I set it up for the next morning. :)
If my cholesterol really goes down at my next check up, it will be well worth the switch - and may be worth it anyway. Good coffee!! Highly recommend!",Sam T,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de abril de 2024

It takes a try or two to get the measurements right when you are making different amounts of coffee, but i just keep a post-it note in my cupboard for the amounts we like now. More coffee scoops are needed than for a drip machine, but it is worth it for the great coffee.

Makes a great cup of hot coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I’ve run the gamut on all sorts of coffee makers and know how to make a good cup of coffee. Pour over using a kettle and kalita wave, v60, or Chemex will get you the most nuanced coffee as long as you know how to pour it. It takes practice and I used to have the time and patience for it, but now I reserve those moments for when I’m truly in the mood. There are good drip brewers out there that make good coffee and I recommend using, especially the ones that brew at the right temps and speed, and I never thought old fashioned percolators can make good coffee. I always thought they “burn” coffee and brewing with recirculated coffee ruins the taste. I was wrong. I recently learned through experience that Percs and can make great coffee. I purchased this coffee maker mostly out of curiosity. I wanted my coffee to stay hotter in my mug for longer, and drip coffee just seemed to cool down too fast, even from the SCAA recommended machines. Preheating the mug is a workaround, but requires an extra step that you really don’t want in the morning. Knowing that percs are known for making hotter coffee, I purchased this one. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. This thing makes great tasting, hot coffee. There is a learning curve though. Here is what works for me:
I put a scoop of ice in the pot along with my water to make it very cold before brewing. These electric percs need very cold water to start to get the best results.
Do not use a filter. I tried using the sample filters that came with the pot but the few times I tried I got very weak coffee. I think these filters allow water to bypass the coffee grounds in the basket, and don’t allow the full and even saturation needed. The benefit you get of easier clean up is not worth getting a horrible tasteless pot of coffee.
Use freshly ground beans. If the beans are freshly roasted, even better. But at a minimum, to get the best tasting coffee from any brew method the beans need to be ground right before brewing. Burr grinders give the best results. However if you don’t have a grinder that’s ok. I buy pre-ground coffee too. I make sure to buy only small containers so the grounds don’t get too stale before they are used.
Grind the beans to a coarseness level slightly above drip. However, regular drip grind works just fine.
Experiment with coffee to water ratios to get the results you want. In this perc I prefer a 20:1 ratio (20 parts of water to 1 part of coffee grounds, by weight).
Unplug the perc shortly after brewing. Doing this will preserve the best flavors of the coffee.
Lastly, after it’s cooled, if there is still unused coffee that you want drink, you can “freshen” it up easily. First take out the basket and tube. Put the lid back on and plug it in again. The pot will start heating the coffee. In about 2 min the light will go on and the coffee will be at the same hot temp again. Unplug the pot and enjoy your cup. (Won’t be a good as first cup but close enough for me).

Using these guidelines for myself, I always get a delicious, full bodied, piping hot coffee that is better than any cheap drip machine, just as good as high quality drip machines, and the coffee stays hot in my mug longer. I was surprised that these vintage style percs made good coffee, but I guess they knew what they were doing 50+ years ago when these were popular. The convenience of drip took over, but I’ve found that percs have a certain charm to them. While not as “convenient” its still very easy to use. I enjoy the sounds it makes, and I like that they are so simple to clean. It’s all metal, no plastic, which also means hot water is not touching any plastic during brewing, which you can’t say for most drip machines. Plus it has a small blueprint so takes up a lot less space. The only thing I wish it had was auto-shut-off. The only way to turn it off is pulling the plug out of the pot. Auto-shut off after 1-2 hours should be a standard feature. I can’t see how leaving the pot on all day would be desirable at all.
Overall I really like this pot. It’s nostalgic and makes great coffee!",RMG,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de diciembre de 2023

"If Your Looking For A Coffee Percolator That Makes Excellent Tasting Coffee, This Is It!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","In the first years of my life, I grew up with a coffee percolator. Its in my humble opinion, a percolator is the best way to make coffee. Back in the 1990's, companies started marketing drip style coffee makers. They would classically show somebody getting coffee grounds all over their percolators, and using that as a reason to switch to drip. Well, it must have worked, because our family switched to drip style coffee makers, and we went through many of them, as they never lasted more then 3 to 5-years!

I gotta be honest, when you've tasted drip brewed coffee, it just isn't as good. When you've tasted percolator brewed coffee, its like a night and day difference. After a power outage spike took out our old coffee maker, it was time to finally go back to the percolator, and we chose the Presto. How does it measure up? Well, let me install a new surge protector first, plug the percolator into it, and then I'll tell ya.

The coffee maker comes packaged fairly well, nice box, cardboard separation inserts. Comes with an included 2-prong power cord, the same kind waffle irons, rice makers, and crock pots use. It comes with a instruction manual, and all the parts that make up the percolator, all packaged in plastic bags, which you must take out, and install properly to get ready for use.

With the lid removed, filter basket and tube, fill the unit with the amount of water you require for the needed cups you want. For example, if you want to make 12-cups of coffee, fill to the 12-cup mark. I grind my own coffee beans with a portable B&D electric coffee grinder. I like my coffee strong, so I fill the grinder to its max level, and I just do a medium grind, that way you don't get a lot of grounds getting past the filter basket into your coffee.

Yes, I am well aware of the age old discussion, to paper filter, or not paper filter, that is the question. To be perfectly honest, using paper filters will indeed alter the taste of the coffee to be less desirable, all to have no grounds at the bottom of the pot. If you do a medium grind, you won't get that many grounds at the bottom of the pot anyway, so I recommend to not use a paper filter for best flavor results.

Once you have filed the filter basket, just place the percolator pickup tube into it, then center the bottom half of the tube, with the bowl shaped recessed notch at the bottom of the coffee pot. Then just hold it in place while you install the lid. The lid literally snaps into place, so there is no way that lid is ever coming off on its own, without human intervention, so you can trust it, which is a plus. Then all you have to do is plug the cord into the wall, and the coffee maker begins percolating after just a few seconds.

When the coffee pot is fully filled, it is surprisingly heavy, so much so, I decided to weigh it. The coffee maker weighs in 6-pounds and 10.7-ounces, that is almost 7-pounds! It is in my opinion, that seniors who are suffering from arthritis, will have quite a bit of difficulty managing this coffee pot. I remember my mother had a lot of trouble, just trying to lift a 12-cup drip style pot. So you might want to use a second hand with a pot holder, to help you support the pot as you pore.

The good news however, is that this pot has an excellent handle, that remains cool to the touch, so you never have to worry about getting burned, as what would happen with a stove top percolator! Additionally, the percolator has a beautiful spout, and it functions as good as it looks, pores beautifully. I recommend that you use filtered water, I use a Britta filter, which is better for your health, and helps to reduce calcium deposits in the coffee pot.

The company claims that the percolator takes 1-minute per cup, so 12-cups = 12-minutes. I am always wary of company claims when it comes to marketing, so I decided to test that. The water sat long enough in the pot to reach room temperature before I plugged it in. As my video clearly shows, the Presto 12-cup percolator took a total of 12-minutes and 55-seconds to finish brewing. So while that is nearly a whole minute longer then company claims, its well within the norm, so they get a pass.....This time.

By now your wondering, all this is well and good, but how does the coffee taste? I am happy to report, that the coffee that this percolator makes, tastes phenomenal! Literally, every time I took a sip, I was in heaven. Its like one of those things that makes you ask yourself, ""what have I been doing with all of my life?"" The answer is, you've been doing it wrong for years, but now you own a percolator, so you've redeemed yourself. I can't recommend the flavor that this machine produces enough!

Please note that, unlike drip style coffee makers that never get the coffee that hot, this percolator makes coffee piping hot, 195-degrees Fahrenheit. Be careful with your first sips, unless you cool it down a bit with some liquid creamer or milk.

Now as far as cleanup is concerned, its not the huge ordeal that companies made it out to be, when they suggested that you switch to drip style coffee makers. Simply, remove the lid, run it under hot water, set aside. Remove the filter basket, knock it against the inside of your trash can, most of the grounds fall in, or use a piece of paper towel to assist. Run the filter basket under hot water to rinse out any remaining grounds. Run some water through the pickup tube, just make sure its clear, set aside to dry.

A quick rinse of the pot as well, not even soap is required, Its literally that simple, and now your percolator will be ready for the next pot you make. I recommend only plugging and unplugging the cord from the male end that goes into the wall, there is really no need to detach it from the coffee maker itself. But when the coffee percolator finishes brewing, it will automatically turn off and switch to warming mode. I don't recommend leaving the pot in warming mode for longer then 30-minutes though, that way the coffee stays fresh and doesn't turn bitter on ya.

I would have preferred that this coffee maker had an on/off switch, but that doesn't appear to be a feature, that is found on percolators in general, not just from this brand. Other then that, I literally have nothing else negative to say about it. The percolator is both beautiful in design, as it is, in its function to make excellent tasting coffee, what more could you want? I really love this coffee maker and I can't recommend it enough. If you've been using a drip style coffee maker, please do yourself a favor, and get a percolator.

I rate this coffee maker a solid 5 out of 5 stars! Highly recommended!",Arthur Senior,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de noviembre de 2020
This is the best percolator I've ever owned,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've just been through 2 Cuisinart PRC-12NC units over the past 4 years. They started making weak coffee after about one year. So, I decided to switch brands to the Presto. Wow, what a difference!

This Presto unit is really built sturdy. On the Cuisinarts the clear plastic bulb/handle on top broke off easily, but on the Presto it's a hard plastic, solid-grip handle that is held in place by a very secure connection on the underside of the lid. This means that the lid is tighter, keeping the heat in better, and it pulls off easily, with a small, but not significant, tug.

Because of the design of the basket/basket cover, the brew is much stronger, requiring less coffee to make a very flavorful cup. I do not, however, use the included paper filters. No need. Very few grinds get through, and I always add a touch more water so that I don't pour them out anyway.

All in all, a really great buy.",Jeff Knight,Revisado en Canadá el 29 de febrero de 2024

All around fantastic coffee maker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We have tried several coffeemakers since starting our family (it takes a lot of coffee to fuel our two-working-parents-with-a-new-house-and-two-children-under-two household) and this, my friends, is THE BEST. To understand my rating you may need to know what we were looking for to begin with, and how this machine satisfied our criteria.

What we wanted
1) First, we needed hot coffee and fast!
2) Coffee must taste good
3) NO plastic - at least where the nearly boiling hot water comes into contact with it
4) Ease of use - KISS rule applies here, as we're operating on very little sleep these days

How it performed

1) This pot knocks this out of the park. It only takes about 6-8 minutes to brew 6 cups. It is HOT and it stays hot for a long time (actually, it will stay hot as long as you have the machine plugged into the outlet, which is a really nice feature when we're home on the weekends). A couple of our other machines actually took longer to brew coffee as we encountered filter problems and other issues. Side note - we keep a huge Brita filter of water in our fridge, and use it for coffee so we don't need all the extra filtering of other machines.

2) The taste of coffee will be affected by many factors, not the least of which is the quality of your selected beans, the roast, how freshly ground it is, and using COLD water to begin, however even with the best coffees our previous coffee makers left something to be desired. This machine consistently makes delicious coffee. Seriously, it is such a pleasure to drink.

3) This one is really important. As we increased the amount of coffee we drink, we realized that pretty much all other machines involve plastic parts somewhere in the brew process, despite having metal baskets and the like. That means there is a pretty good chance some unhealthful substances could be leaching into the water, and into the coffee. We use steel and glass with our other beverages and for our children's drinks - but had ignored the almost 16 oz of coffee a day we were consuming! This entire machine, with the exception of the base and handle, is steel. All that boiling hot water comes in contact with is metal. I suspect that also has something to do with how well it performs on the flavor scale.

4) Again, home run. This machine isn't any more labor intensive to use than a Mr. Coffee or a Cuisinart. In fact, it might be simpler since you don't have to pour water from a carafe into some silly little hole somewhere on the machine, risking spilling water all over the counter. Fill the carafe with cold water. Fill the basket with grounds. Insert bar, basket, and lids. Plug it in. Pour your cereal, hug your kids, pack your lunch, whatever you fancy. 8 minutes later you're pouring a delicious, hot mug of joe. We have a grinder and only buy whole bean coffee. Sometimes we grind the coffee the night before to save time, but plenty of mornings we have grind it just before making the coffee. Still a simple and quick process..even when we are exhausted.

Additionally, you can make small amounts of coffee without needing a special setting. The coffee isn't any weaker as a result, unlike other machines. I think this has to do with how hot this machine gets the water prior to brewing. It isn't heating up along the way, like some other machines. So the first few cups are just as good as the rest. You can, however, make a big full pot, which is nice for us because our parents come to visit often and all drink coffee too. And the whole big pot is piping hot. That brings me to a negative aspect of this machine. If you brew a pot, and want another, you have to wait until the pot cools. I've been raving about how hot it makes coffee, and that it's made of metal. Well, it becomes a dangerously hot piece of metal. Clean up is easy with this machine too. We compost our grounds so it is as simple as dumping the basket into our compost container, and rinsing out the parts. Something to be mindful of, though, is ensuring that you UNPLUG the machine before you leave. Best case scenario, you return to hot coffee in the evening, if that's your thing, but I'm afraid of causing an electrical fire so our post-coffee routine is simply unplugging it before leaving for work. Again, it is usually too hot to clean right away so we do this in the evening.

You'll notice some features we weren't looking for, and which this product does not have:

1) Brew interrupt for pouring a cup while it is still brewing. We aren't that impatient. We have plenty to do while we wait for the full pot to brew. But some folks may not like that.

2) Clock - we have that on our stove...and our phones...and our toaster oven...and our wall. We're good with clocks

3) Programmable brewing - again, not necessary for us as we find using this machine to be quick and easy. We did enjoy this feature on other products (waking up to coffee brewing for you is so nice!) but the trade off for no plastic parts was worth it to us. Plus, my husband is so sweet about getting up first and making the coffee, so not much has changed for me in this way ;-)

Well, this is the longest review I have ever written, but I know how people are about their coffee...because I am one of those people. I hope this review helps.

Tips for a genuinely amazing cup of a coffee...,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My family has owned this percolator for 6 years now, purchased right here on Amazon in 2010, and I'm about to buy another one for work.

This pot has consistently delivered the best tasting coffee - better than all restaurants we frequent, better than friends and family's coffee... just awesomely, amazingly good. I've had a couple of minor maintenance issues over the years (see below) but they were super easily overcome, and in general this has been a super-reliable and very inexpensive appliance. Honestly, this has to have been one of my most favorite appliance purchases ever. And all for less than $40. Take THAT, you overpriced, overly featured drip machines that make lousy coffee!! ;-)

*TIPS*

With this, and any other stainless percolator, there are some basic guidelines to follow that aren't necessarily in the manual:

1. DO NOT use a paper filter. Ever. Use the metal basket ONLY. The holes are tiny enough to allow the coffee through, but to keep 99.9% of the gains in. Using the metal basket without a paper filter allows the flavor oils that naturally exist in the coffee bean to STAY in the coffee and contribute to its amazing and full flavor. If you use a paper filter, you'll lose the oils and get an ""over-extracted"" flavor that's more bitter than bold... so don't use a paper filter, follow the instructions, and you're GOLDEN - perfect coffee every time. Yes, you'll get a couple of grains in the last cup without a paper filter... whoop-de-do, just don't drink the very last few drops of the very last cup - problem solved. ;)

2. Cleaning the pot: Make sure it's clear of any build-up, but don't scrub the interior... allow the percolator to become seasoned. It's hot enough to prevent any bacterial issues, just like a wok or a cookie sheet. So let that puppy get seasoned, it's perfectly safe AND more delicious over time! The key place for build up is the receiving ""hole"" at the bottom of the pot for the metal tube. That can build up coffee debris pretty quick, and if you don't clear it, it will keep the metal tube from seating properly and you won't be able to brew properly, if at all. You only need to scrape away the excess with a fingernail, and you're good to go. The outside of the pot, however, feel free to scrub and make super shiny. It's really a nice looking piece when cleaned!

3. Cleaning the basket: The basket's tiny holes can get plugged up over a month or so of daily use. There's two ways to deal with this: chemically (cleaners) or with a wire brush. I prefer the wire brush route and just tap the bottom of the basket, which instantly clears the holes and allows you to keep the years of perfect seasoning intact. Wire brush FTW.

4. When assembling the pot in order to brew coffee, if you don't get the metal tube lined up with the receiving hole in the bottom of the pot, you'll get a misfire where you'll get a weak pot of coffee (at best), if not a mere pot of hot water. To ensure this doesn't happen, once the metal tube is aligned with the receiving hole, twist it left and right like you're trying to gently screw it in. It doesn't actually screw in... the twisting movement simply forces it to pop into the hole if it isn't in the hole already. Best. Trick. Ever.

5. Don't overfill the basket with coffee - the closer you are to the top of the tube, the more likely to get grains in the bottom of the pot. However, don't underfill or you'll get weak coffee. Follow the instructions, and you should be fine.

6. It's OK to let the coffee sit plugged in and ready to go for a long time as a FULL pot. If you're going to be leaving less than half a pot for more than an hour, UNPLUG IT, the coffee can burn if it sits long enough, just like ANY coffee pot. However, I've let a full pot sit for 4 or 5 hours, plugged in, and it's still not bad at all. Obviously, the fresher the better - just don't let it sit plugged in with very little coffee left, or your coffee will be understandably less delicious than you were expecting.

7. MAINTENANCE: I've had to replace the wire/plug once because using it thousands of times caused it to develop a minor short. Any plug/wire off the shelf that fits will do... it's just a straight up, no frills, 2 prong AC cable. Easy-peasy. I've also seen the screws holding on the bottom decay over time as they're not made of rust-resistant metal, sadly. However, a quick trip to your local hardware store will get you brand new ones; just bring the old ones with and ask the hardware guy for help. I replaced the bottom screws about 2 years ago when they got too rusty, so I got 4 years out of mine. You might be able to forestall the rusty screws issue by covering the holes with hot glue to prevent water from getting up in there when you wash the outside. That'd probably work perfectly, but I haven't actually tried it.

Finally, stop reading reviews, buy this pot, and enjoy your awesome coffee!!!",Robb Ryniak,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de octubre de 2016
Presto 12 cup electric percolator,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","My drip coffee maker needed replaced ASAP. The base was getting really hot and that would not be good for safety. Decided a percolator would be the better choice for both taste and longevity. It was the right choice for taste. Won't know about longevity until I get 4-6 years out.

Pros: The design is beautiful, fits with my decor and is a much smaller footprint than the drip maker. Easy to pour. No carafe breakage if bumped. Stainless steel throughout equals easy to clean (but the taste of the coffee improved by letting it season).
Cons: It was a little bit of a learning curve to get the coffee right. It required more coffee to get the taste right as compared to my drip coffee maker, but with that said, the taste was superior in this pot. No automatic features meant I had to buy a cheap timer that would handle the wattage of the pot, not a big deal. I had read up about grounds in the coffee for percolators and solved that problem by also buying French press screens and cutting them to size. One for the bottom and one for the top = no grounds in coffee. No way to really tell when you're at the end of the pot as there's no viewing window is the only feature I miss.

Summary: excellent machine with better tasting coffee that's beautiful to look at and easier to clean if you can deal with the minor hassles plus added expense of a timer and metal screens.",Indigo,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de enero de 2024
FINALLY no plastic in my coffee!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","If you've gone down the rabbit hole about potential dangers of plastic exposure to hot water and steam then you'll never look at your coffee machine and kettle with ease again. So far it's been actually impossible to find a plug in kettle in Canada that has zero plastic exposure but at least my coffee is solved!

NO plastic exposure was my biggest objective so this product gets full marks. As a replacement for common 12 cup coffee machines this product is almost perfect; it just needs one simple hack and it's perfect. I like waking up to coffee ready to go so a programmable clock/computer feature is necessary and no matter how much money you spend on Bonavita or Technivorm, there's plastic! Some other reviewer mentioned using this perc and a smart plug and that's what I ended up doing and it works FLAWLESSLY. I set this thing up at night and the smart plug ensures I have fresh hot coffee when I wake up. Even better, if my kid wakes me up earlier than expected, I just turn on the plug from my phone in bed and the perc will get my coffee going right away so it's pretty much ready when I get downstairs - even better than a programmable 12 cupper. T

Oh yeah! I found the paper filters this perc claims to require are not needed! I still had a ton of #4 cone filters from my old 12 cupper and guess what? It's all just paper so you can totally use those here too! I just put a tiny hole using the stem of the basket and push the rest of the filter in there. it fits well enough way less messy when putting in coffee than the two filters that came with the perc.

I guess my last thing to mention would coffee quality. I'm not exactly a snob so my review of coffee quality should be taken with a grain of salt. I love me a 5 dollar espresso pulling on a 10K rig at my local hipster coffee shop but first thing in the morning at home I actually want a classic cheap sludge. Maxwell House/Folgers is fine for me! So with that disclaimer, I will say this makes awesome strong coffee. Probably burnt and stuff but again, this is comparing to fancy coffee makers. This perc versus a common 12 cup machine is just fine - no discernable difference. If you're one of those people that cares about water temp, grind size, brew time, and all that snobby stuff than yeah this'll probably won't meet your needs. I'd rather just go to a coffee shop for a perfect cup of coffee rather than spend thousands of dollars to recreate that at home. This perc will get you awesome brewed coffee like the standard drip you get a Timmy's etc.",donlon,Revisado en Canadá el 15 de octubre de 2020

Best purchase of 2018! Updated,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this for work and we make 4 to 5 pots a day with it.
It works so well I bought another one for the house!
The coffee is consistent in strength and flavor.....best of all piping hot!! Seriously hot....

The unit at work has made over 800 pots easily, functions the same as when it was new. We have refined the process to get the best results.

- Use your standard fine grind coffee (coarser the grind the weaker the brew)
- The perc will make between 2 - 12 cups, typically we go with 7 level tablespoons of coffee (Folgers) per 8 cup pot (this varies between coffee types and grinds)
- get the Melitta 3.5"" disc filters
- Place one filter disc ONE ON TOP OF COFFEE IN BASKET AND NOT ON THE BOTTOM.....this seems like backwards thinking but has given the best results by far. Again....one one the top and NONE on the bottom.
- Cleaning is easy, usually just a rinse and quick wipe. Run through white vinegar every once and a while when staining becomes substantial. Also be sure the ""washer"" on the bottom of the perc tube can move freely and isn't gummed up.
FYI..The filters are a lot cheaper on amazon.com and they will ship them to Canada.

Enjoy!

UPDATE:
July 2019 - Presto percolator is well over 1500 pots now and works as good as day 1. Fantastic!

Not worth the price,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought the Presto to replace a Hamilton Beach percolator we had used for several years. The reviews here and online for the Presto were good so I assumed it would be a quality product. I am disappointed after just one use.

Looks good
Pours well
Makes piping hot coffee

I loved my old Gevalia drip maker but when it broke ...,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Not a coffee connoisseur but was tired of replacing expensive drip coffee makers. I loved my old Gevalia drip maker but when it broke it had been discontinued. This percolator makes hot coffee in decent time. The filter is more time consuming than a basket type. I bought lg basket filters and hole punched to avoid buying the expensive wrap kind. Works fine but does add more to the routine than just dumping in coffee grinds. I haven't used percolator grind coffee yet so no comment there. My goal was to make my usual morning inexpensive cup and this does the trick. I will say that it is so hot that if you have less than 2 cups of coffee left in the pot it tends to ""cook"" after awhile. But at least you don't have to use a microwave for a refill. You do need to remember to unplug it before leaving the house as there is no automatic shut off. I just rinse the inside with my sink sprayer and wipe the outside with a damp cloth. Used a sponge if needed for the tube and basket, but generally not needed. I've had it a couple months. Seems sturdy .

It’s now fall 2021. 7yrs old!?!?! This machine still works as good as the day we bought it. We no longer take the time to punch holes in the filters. We simply take an 8-12c paper filter (bought in bulk) and push it down over the stem in the basket. The paper is thin enough if you press down it simply tears into a small hole anyway. My husband fills up the water and puts coffee in the night before and simply plugs it in the morning as in 5am! It’s brewed in a couple minutes which is enough time for him to get dressed, wash face, brush teeth, etc. (lol he’s fast and has it down to an art) And, it still makes hot coffee and keeps it hot. Still shiny and clean looking too. I just occasionally wipe it down when I’m cleaning the kitchen counters after a meal.

****edit
So after almost 8 years my percolator died on me. I started to buy a new cord in case that was the problem bc it was a little expensive to replace the whole thing. Not that we didn’t get our money’s worth, just wasn’t a good time to have another thing break! However, when the cord arrived I found out that my husband had already thrown the percolator away figuring it couldn’t be saved. So I don’t know what would’ve happened with the new cord. I ended up buying the Hamilton beach percolator instead bc it was on sale which if you’re interested just know that it has a sturdier cord than the presto. Still, I wouldn’t hesitate to buy one of these again since it did last so long. Too bad the price was a little high (like all things nowadays)",K.

Feels like I've come back home!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I'm an avid coffee drinker. And after 15+ years of the highly-convenient drip Bunn (which I've sworn by specifically because it keeps a reservoir of water hot all the time so coffee's done in 3 minutes), I stumbled upon a thumbnail of the Presto Electric Percolator which I'd originally come to think of as old fashioned and outdated in convenience. But it's what I grew up with. LOTS of reviews. And almost all of them, stellar. The ones that got to me though were ""full bodied"" and especially ""smell the coffee."" And then there were mentions that it keeps the coffee perfectly hot and a long, long time before it starts to taste burnt.

I ordered one, and it truly feels like I've come back home. The taste is a WORLD better. The smell of coffee fills the house. It's way more hassle than the Bunn (filter discussion follows) but it's just sooo worth it. And it takes a lot less counterspace. I am back in coffee lover's heaven.

FILTERS: I never used them when I had a percolator before (isn't the basket the filter?) but I've read a number of reasons why they're a good idea, and I made a pot without, and a pot with. I liked with. Taste and also cleanup, and then the nagging thing about whatever it filters out which I don't recall, but google it if you have concerns.

The square filters (sample pack comes in the box) with the pre-punched holes are ridiculously expensive. About 10 cents each which, in my case, would add up fast because I make 6-cup pots rather than 12's just because I like it freshly made. But it so happens that the floor of the commonly-available unbleached, round basket filters fit PERFECTLY into the floor of the 12-cup basket. And they go up the sides to right where this coffee pot's filter cover lands. I mean, a perfect fit. To cut the center hole, I take 5 or so filters at a time, and gently fold them in half, then in half again. That gives you dead center. (And if you fold carefully, you'll keep the convenient shape they come in.) Just snip off the teensiest corner--like about 1/16th of an inch because it will quadruple in size when unfolded. After a couple of times, you'll get the hang of curved snipping so it's a perfect fit over the basket's center post with no gaps. (Yes, this is a TAD of extra hassle, but we've all gotten an awfully low threshold for what we consider hassle.) These filters cost 01 cent vs. 10 cents each.

The only claim Presto makes that I don't find true on mine is 1 minute per cup. Mine took 8 minutes for 2 cups and it takes 8 minutes for 6 cups. Pfffft. Not an issue when the quality of the coffee is this outstanding, but I'm just mentioning it in case that's a biggie for someone reading this.

So while Bunn has been a WONDERFUL company, with their 3-year warranty (whereupon they will totally replace your coffee pot at no charge if anything wears out), and they're one of the few companies where you can readily talk to a human, and one who speaks English, I have no choice but to convert.

Now an Off Topic addition, and I don't work for Amazon - no affiliation, but this suggests you consider buying one accessory because I LOVE mine. A long handled coffee scoop. I bought the Norpro (there are others) but this little sucker is just wonderful. 2 Tbsp. exactly (one scooper per 2 cups) and I can get 1 tbsp. by tilting my coffee jar (contents level) and pushing this in halfway. The edge comes out vertical, so it's pretty darned exact. But I keep my coffee in a 1-qt. mason jar and the long handle goes all the way to the bottom (or if you buy your coffee in bags, same thing). Solid stainless, really great feel with great heft and a hole at the end so you can hang it. (Makes a great ladle also). Just saying. So here 'tis. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SSVGIY/ref=oh_details_o03_s01_i00. Note that packaging MAY say 1 Tbsp. but it's two, and says so on the back of the handle. Short handled coffee measure are a pain after using one of these.

I give this Presto 12-cup percolator the highest of ratings. It makes great coffee and it keeps it at a perfect temperature. It has a small footprint, a substantial enough cord (though not as solid a connector as they used to be before China makes everything but that's replaceable if need be). It's just a really good, good cup of coffee. Me very happy camper.",CF,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de diciembre de 2012
super hot coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have been using this product for 20 years. Replaced 3 times in 20 years. Hot coffee even hours later with no bitterness. Easy to clean stainless steel inside and out. No filters no mess drip .

Bitterly Beloved,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","It’s been three months with this percolator — my first, after switching from drip — and it’s made some of then best coffee I’ve ever had.

It’s also made the absolute worst.

What’s the difference? Sheer luck, as far as I can tell. I swear I do the same thing every time, and some cups are rich and delicious while others are bitter brown water. I’ve researched, I’ve experimented, I’ve Googled until my fingers went numb, and I can’t find the answer.

I love this machine. I also hate it. I wish I’d never bought it, and yet I know we’ll be together until one of us dies. This is the most toxic relationship I’ve ever been in. I just wanted good home-brewed coffee, you know? How did it end up like this?",Tara Reed,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de marzo de 2024
Don't you want GREAT coffee??,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Problem: I use filtered water. I buy the best coffee. I spared no expense on coffeemakers. But still the flavor was never right. How do I know this? I know this because I patronize places such as Starbucks and McDonald's who are the standard for good coffee and the coffee there was always better than at my house. Why was that? Why can't I have good coffee? I mean, the coffee comes out of a fancy dispenser. There is a clock. I can program it. Why isn't the coffee any good?
The reason is that restaurants use serious machines made of steel that get coffee scalding hot and that gives you great coffee. (Remember McDonald's lawsuit?) The coffee from these machines, if poured into your present plastic coffeemaker, would just melt it. Dioxins, anyone? You cannot get serious coffee from plastic innards in any way, shape, or form. You need steel and glass and nothing else will do.

Solution: My no expense spared, research intensive quest to get the best in-home coffee short of spending tens of thousands on a restaurant quality machine. The answer is Presto. Yes. A $39 percolator made of stainless steel. Best coffee I have ever had. Best coffee you will ever have. All the reviews say this, too. Presto lovers say the coffee tastes best, first and foremost, and isn't that what it is all about? In fact, look at the reviews of other coffeemakers and the ""features"" get priority. The reason the Presto makes such good coffee is that it doesn't just drip through. No, it recirculates the coffee back through the grounds over and over at scalding hot temperatures to extract every bit of flavor from the coffee. That is how you get the best coffee! My Hamilton Beach barely got the filter wet.

Taste: If you want the best tasting coffee do what our parents and grandparents did before us and get a percolator made of stainless steel. You can't go wrong. NOW, your coffee tastes great and easily compares to Starbucks!

Grounds: You may be wondering what to do about this new issue. Granted, with the pummeling the coffee grounds take some will eventually find their way into your cup. I have found that with the disk filter, when wetted, there are hardly any grounds, if any.

Filters:
1. No filter. Get maximum flavor and possibly some grounds. Coffee purists do this with larger ground coffee and just let the fully enclosed metal canister do the filtering.
2. Flat disk filter. Same great flavor and a barely any grounds. I do this. After practicing by wetting it first, I get no grounds.
3. Enclosed fold top filter. Absolutely no grounds but slightly less bold flavor. Might have to add little more grounds. Remember you want that scalding water to hit the grounds directly for max flavor.

You can take the canister out, it serves no purpose after brewing is complete. Might prevent grounds from floating in.

Clean-up: Easy. The easiest. There is no coffee machine that is easier to clean up.

Quiet: Yes, it is completely silent when it is finished. (But boy does it snap, crackle and pop when brewing! Awesome!) For example, after brewing my Hamilton Beach Brewstation just churned and gurgled and sputtered on its own condensation non-stop for hours . Kind of annoying. Would never stop gurgling until shut off.

Summary: Flavor. It is why you drink coffee. Get the most flavor possible with the Presto (or any other percolator for that matter) but just get it! Everything about this low-tech wonder is simple. Making coffee, dispensing, and clean up. Simple. Easy. In fact, easier than what you are using now. Why did we ever get away from percs? Drips are messier and are harder to clean up, and the plastic calcifies requiring periodic cleaning and also passes its `flavor' on to the coffee making it bitter.

Great Pot but...,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This seems like a nice pot. The coffee is piping hot! But when I saw the filter basket I was disappointed - my experience with filters with just holes on the bottom wasn't good - lets too many grounds go through and you must use a paper filter, which I didn't want to do. My old pot, a Hamilton Beach, was very good at not letting many grounds through, but the filter basket had slots rather than holes. (The Hamilton Beach that Amazon has for sale only has the small spout, which I didn't like at all, and the ""retro"" spout model was not available.) Just out of curiosity, I tried the filter basket from my old Hamilton Beach pot and, surprise, it fit the new Presto pot. So I tried the pot with the old filter basket and it makes a great cup of coffee with very little grounds in the coffee. But you must remove the filter basket before you pour any coffee or you will ge grounds in the coffee.

May all your coffee dreams come true.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I pretty much need coffee to get going in the morning. For the past few years, I've tinkered with so different methods of making coffee. We had a Cuisinart brewer, a Keurig, a Hamilton Beach single cup/or full pot brewer (piece of junk, bought here..... Hamilton Beach Single Serve Coffee Brewer and Full Pot Coffee Maker, 2-Way (49980A) ), a Baletti stove top maker and a french press. Used all of them with varying degrees of success.

For me, as for many, the two main problems with coffee is brew temp and strength of the brew. Drip brewers just don't make hot enough coffee for me; I don't think any machine makes hot enough water to make good coffee, and the elements wear out over time so the coffee just gets weaker and weaker. It's a slow descent, so slow that you don't even realize you're drinking crap coffee till you run into a really good cup. Then, the truth sinks in and you go buy/try another method.

French presses are ok, but my hubby doesn't like sediment in his coffee, and frankly I'm not a huge fan of it either. Same problem with the Bialetti-- plus, they are cast aluminum, and I think they impart a metallic taste to the brew. They also only circulate the water through the coffee once, so you miss some of the complexity in a really good cup. Plus, no filter=mud in the bottom of your cup, and a slightly grainy texture.

Ok, to the review. This machine is lovely. I mean, it's beautiful! I know my friends are going to be all, OOOH AHH did you get that at an antique store? It's just so gleaming and retro. It pleases me in some ineffable way. I'm a dork.

But mainly, it makes screaming hot, strong, clear coffee. I used a 4-12 cup basket filter (flat bottom, ruffled sides) and cut a hole in the bottom as other reviewers have suggested; and also heeding their advice, I wet the filter and pressed it to the sides of the basket. I followed the manufacturer's recommendation on the amount of coffee; well, I put probably a little extra in, but I really didn't need to. I think the amount they suggest is just right for coffee the way I like it; strong but not jet fuel. Clear, not muddy. I'm drinking the inaugural cup right now and I am quite pleased with it.

I can see that there might be a learning curve on cleaning it, as it is quite tall and cleaning the spout will take a thin-ish brush. A bottle brush is in my future, I think. No big deal. Keeping the plug dry will be the main thing, but I think I will manage.

It brews really fast. It actually came in a little faster than ""a minute per cup"". It's as fast as most drip machines, IMO.

I read the reviews carefully and I can say that there IS aluminum in this pot, but it is not the screw at the bottom, just the little ""well"" where the stem fits into the bottom. It's not enough to worry me, but if you are concerned, be thou ware.

My husband moaned last weekend, ""Can't we just get a regular freaking coffee maker?"" after he wrangled with the Bialetti and lost, making a mess and a pretty nasty cuppa joe. I can't wait to set this puppy up for him tomorrow morning. He loves percolated coffee on camping trips, and this is so much easier; you don't have to watch it, you can set it up ahead of time, plug it in, take your shower and tah-dah! Coffee!",S.

Note to those who have a water softener (salt based),"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Here are some tips to yield a successful brew:

- use this on a level surface for uniform brewing in the basket (this is also true of auto drip makers).

- cold refrigerated water (for proper brew time). Using water above 40° F will shorten the brew time and the result will be an inconsistent, weak brew.

- grind size needs to perfect. Have your own grinder will help greatly.

- Softened water (salt based type) can cause flow issues both in percolators and auto drip brewers as well. The softened water doesn't flow through filters and ground coffee very well, resulting in an overflow which can yield grounds in the coffee and an overall weak brew (because the water is overflowing the basket and not brewing through the coffee grounds).

When the percolators were a common brewer in households, grocery stores had pre-ground coffee for the ""percolator"" available on shelves alongside auto-drip pre-ground coffee. Over time, with the popularity of the auto-drip maker, the ""percolator"" pre-ground coffee demand lessened and was phased out. So having your own grinder is necessary to deliver the best flavor while allowing you to experiment with grind size for the best flow and flavor.

I use a Baratza Encore grinder set at around 30 with good results for most roasts (typically medium to medium dark); for darker roasts, try a coarser grind of 31-32. Using a 1:17 ratio is a starting point to a smooth full-bodied brew (70g coffee at the 8 cup* water mark (1183ml). *FYI: coffee cups are 5oz, not 8oz like a measuring cup.

The presto electric percolator works poorly with filters (regardless of grind size) as the water will drain too slow causing water to overflow the basket, resulting in a mess and weak coffee. If you insist on using a filter: start with a medium to medium-coarse grind (~20 on the Baratza encore).

When using the basket without a paper filter, be-sure to wet the basket prior to adding coffee. This will help provide a cleaner cup of coffee. I find the Melitta discs work well, but if you are using softened water any filter used will most likely cause issues as the flow rate will be greatly hampered.

To prevent build-up, always clean the brewer after use. Immediately after brewing, I will remove the spreader (basket lid) and spray a dilute solution of dawn and water the wipe with a sponge and rinse. Next using a silicone mitt or trivet I remove the brew basket (dump grounds in trash) then spray with the soap solution, wipe and rinse. Finally, use the pump tube as a stir to uniformly mix brew and wash the pump tube. Prior to use, make sure the washer on the pump tube moves freely. It should make a click sound when you plunge the tube up & down in water. When done using the serving pot, I will spray the interior of the pot with soap solution, wipe thoroughly with a sponge and rinse. Be sure to not get the outside of the pot too wet.

Cleaning after each use will yield consistent daily results, as a slight build up can affect the temp sensors in the brew pot, which may cause the brewer to shorten the brew cycle or prevent the unit from switching to the warming mode.

The heating well should also be wiped with a finger and paper towel as a burnt residue of coffee forms in there as well.

Great quality value and hot coffee!!!!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I love love love this percolator!!!! My old Mr Coffee we got as a wedding present 27 years ago finally died. As I have become over the years quite a coffee snob and addict (admittance is the first step), I have to have GOOD tasting coffee or my day is ruined. My husband and I were served the best tasting coffee we've had in a long time at a State Lodge and when I asked the waitress what kind it was she laughed and said good old Folgers but we use a percolator. That was it! I began my search. I ordered the Presto 12 cup percolator. It gives me 4.5 normal coffee cups (picture to show cup size)or two travel mugs, which is exactly the amount we drink in the morning. I used the wrap around filters that came with it and my regular medium roast coffee we have always used to see if we could taste a difference. Boy did we! No bitterness, no grounds, and the hottest cup of coffee. Perfect! It takes it about 10 min to percolate and stays on and hot until it's all gone. I ordered the disc filters and tried those out when the other ones ran out. Got on Amazon and ordered the wrap around. I read reviews that said it made weak coffee and got grounds in their coffee. They must not have read the instructions. For 12 cups we use@6-7 tablespoon and half scoops of our medium roast coffee. I would say they didn't add enough coffee for amount of water or it's light roast possibly? As far as grounds go, I think you really need to use the wrap around filters to make sure it's getting all the grounds contained so you have a clearer cup of coffee that has no bitterness. It's very well made and seems to be of high quality. I use only filtered water through my Brita pitcher since our tap water has a lot of calcium and minerals in it. I also wash everything after we are done in the morning. Hopefully this will help it to last longer than some that said it only lasted months? I'll let you know. Great value and great coffee! Read instructions and try it out for yourself. I did buy some Folgers to try when the other wrap around filters come. It will be perfect to take when we go camping also!

Satisfied the coffee snobs in the family,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","It's an easy buy, truthfully, just click buy and get it. My uncle has an all body stainless steel presto, a gift from his father in the late 60's. I've always wanted one because it tastes great and we grew up have coffee at his house on Sundays. But being a busy tech prone family we've always had the stainless steel thermal carafe from Mr. Coffee or a similar timer unit. It made a decent cup but never tasted amazing so I also have a french press and drip coffee. After the 3rd one was shot to hell, I finally had to breakout the cheap but brand new plastic Mr. Coffee I was given as a business gift. It makes a terrible cup. The worst weakest flavor I've ever had. :( So I researched best I could info about percolators. Ever time presto came back as the winner. Finally triggered the purchase a few days ago. Realizing that over the past month we blew through 2 costco size bags of coffee and a whole bag of imported coffee that cost at least 50 bucks!!!!! At this rate we were not only going to go broke but still have tasteless coffee to complain about daily. I just did a test run about an hour ago and this unit is great!!! So if you have a krups grinder. We did a test run with a level 6 coarse grind with 6 servings and 32oz ( for 12 Presto cups ) of water. It could be a little bit stronger but it's excellent in flavor. For latte days or cuban coffee days I'll do a level 6 coarse grind with 8 tbsp servings. Already today we used 1/3 of the beans to get the same amount of coffee. Not only is this going to save money but grief. The amount of whining I've heard for weeks has been nothing but praise and surprised reactions in the last hour, and we just got the delivery today. The only thing to note is the aluminum bolt inside the unit is not stainless steel like my uncle's unit, but it's not a big deal being I've been drinking plastic coffee for 6 weeks, so this is a massive improvement. Hopefully they switch back to stainless someday. It brews super hot so be careful and we did not use a filter at all. My uncle never does but he told me that once the coffee is brewed to pour the left overs into a thermal carafe and rinse the unit out with cold water once the unit cools down. That Eventually it'll season like his and will get better flavor without the grounds ever being an issue. It's delicious and probably one of the best scores on amazon.",Murderess Marbie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de marzo de 2021
Just buy it!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this Presto to replace a Mr. Coffee programmable drip coffee maker. Out of the box, the Mr. Coffee machine had a non-working warming plate. Then, after a bit of thought, recalled that I wasn't especially happy with the last 2 or 3 drip coffee makers I owned. They produced adequate coffee, but nothing out of the ordinary, nothing spectacular. While browsing for a new coffee maker, I came upon the Presto and read the great reviews and also the not so great reviews. Since the positive reviews far outnumbered the negative ones, I took the plunge and couldn't be happier!

This machine is simplicity in itself. Every part is able to be easily cleaned due to the few number of parts it consists of. A simple rinse between uses is about all that's needed. Maybe once a month a more thorough cleaning is necessary to remove any stains from the coffee or the oils produced by making coffee.

I use the flat bottomed Mr. Coffee (#4) basket filters with the Presto. It takes just a second to poke a hole in the bottom to get it over the stem and into the basket. So far, not one ground has ended up in my coffee regardless of how fine, or coarse my coffee is.

For each and every drip machine I've owned, none has made coffee as hot as I like it. After brewing, I've always had to put the cup in my microwave for varying times to get it to the temperature I like. I like mine one step below scalding but your mileage may vary. I tested the temperature of the Presto after a full brew of 12 cups and it was 195 degrees F. After doing some research on the internet, discovered that the optimal temperature for brewing is between 195-200 degrees, so this coffee maker was spot on! Although this temperature may seem too hot to some, it's actually quite beneficial for the following reason: the hotter the water, the less coffee is needed for full flavor extraction. In the drip makers, I was using 6-8 spoons of coffee per 4 cups of water to achieve the flavor I most enjoyed. With the Presto, the ratio was 1 spoon of coffee to make 1 cup of coffee, or 4 spoons of coffee per 4 cups of coffee. So, my usage of coffee grounds was halved to make a much hotter, full-bodied, delicious cup of coffee!

The only down side to the Presto, compared to the auto coffee makers, is lack of a timer. The fix to this was the addition of an appliance timer which costs perhaps $5-$7. I like to have my coffee waiting for me when I awaken in the morning so add the water, filter, and coffee before bed. I have all the tabs of the timer removed except for just one which turns the pot on about an hour before I wake. I don't have to worry about ""off"" since I unplug the pot after drinking my morning coffee. Of course, I could always manually plug in the pot and wait about five minutes, but find a timer more to my liking.

Another nice feature of this coffee maker is the small footprint it has as opposed to the larger plastic automatic coffee makers. With proper care and cleaning, am hoping to get a lot of years out of this great machine. And, thanks to Amazon's Prime shipping, it arrived on Christmas Eve in time for a large family gathering when it took its ""maiden voyage."" Thanks Amazon and thanks Presto!",RichardC,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de diciembre de 2013
Plastic-free coffee! Revised because difficulty brewing larger quantities,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this thing. I have been doing a lot of research, trying to find a coffee maker that is free of plastic. I don't like french press because I prefer filtered coffee. We've been doing pour-over, but there is no way to keep it hot, and I like my coffee HOT. Also my husband doesn't like having to baby-sit the pour-over, coming back over and over to pour more water in it. He wanted something easier to use and more automatic. The PRESTO is our answer. The coffee is great - and we are Seattle coffee snobs. Hot, strong, easy to brew. It is as easy to brew 2 cups as 12, so this will also be great when we have guests. And I can feel good that we aren't getting heated-up micro-plastics in our bodies from using it.
I forgot to say that the filters that come with the unit are dumb, buy yourself some disc-type filters and those work great with it!
Revised after 1 month of use: this thing works great for 4-6 cups but when you get in the 8-12 cup range the coffee is very WEAK! I am so disappointed because I wanted to be able to use this for when I serve a crowd. I have tried putting in more scoops of coffee, as many as the unit can hold, but that does not solve the problem. I would welcome any input.",LJMama,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de septiembre de 2023
I love it,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","6/30/21
I'm editing my review to comment on what other people have said about this percolator. Before automatic drip coffeemakers there were percolators and as a child in the '70s I grew up hearing the typical perking sound every morning in the kitchen. My mother had one of those Corningware percolators with the blue cornflower on the side.

Even though coffee sold in cans were a larger grind made for percolators it still wasn't guaranteed no coffee grounds would end up in your cup. It's part and parcel of drinking perked coffee. Expect it to happen. Today's coffee grind is smaller and therefore you'll get more grounds in the coffee. I have found that a certain big box store, with a blue logo has their own coffee, I use the Colombian roast with is 100% Arabica beans (the only way to go), which has a slightly bigger grind and does really well in the percolator.

Is it perfect? No and I don't mind the few grounds on the bottom of my cup and I remember what it was like to drink the bottom of my mother's coffee as a kid and coffee grounds were much larger back then. If I really don't want any grinds in my cup, I just use a small wire mesh strainer and pour thru that. It catches 99% of the grinds.

I don't ever recall seeing any little see thru windows with numbers on them on the coffeepots so you know how much water to put in it, it always had numbers on the inside, unless it was a glass percolator like the Pyrex stove-top one. You just saw the numbers on the inside and poured in the water. People got spoiled with drip coffeemakers.

The stem of the percolator fits in the nut on the bottom. It will not slide around if you fit it right. Yes, you may have to hold it with one hand while putting the coffee basket on it. I'm so used to it that I can eyeball it thru the basket and using one hand get it on the stem. I wet the bottom of the basket (let the water drain out) and then add my coffee. This supposedly helps keep the grounds in the basket. I'm not really sure if it actually works but it's more of a learned behavior thru my mom. The basket top just sits on the top of the basket, It doesn't snap in place.

Yes some older electric percolators had a strength dial or lever on them which allowed one to set the coffee pot to their desired strength but I don't find it necessary or even needed as this brews a great cup of coffee. It all depends on the coffee you buy and the amount used. I have a coffee scoop and 1 scoop is about 2 tablespoons of coffee. For 10 cups of coffee I use 4 scoops (8 tablespoons) but it's supposed to be 6 scoops (12 tablespoons) or 1 tablespoon per cup but even for me that's a bit too strong. Either way, adjust the coffee amount to your desired coffee strength. It will take some experimenting on your part but once you got what you like you love using your percolator like I do.

holes in basket too small.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",It makes good coffee and fast but the holes in the basket are too small so the basket filles with water and over flows and washes the grounds out.

Presto! Coffee with Flavor,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I am a coffee drinker, and have been for decades. I have tried most systems out there-French Press, Filters of all kinds, stovetop espresso pots, etc. Of all of those, French Press makes pretty good coffee. But this Presto percolator extracts more flavor than any of them to my taste.

Here are some clues. The kitchen fills with the smell of coffee brewing. It's nice, and I haven't smelled that wonderful, welcoming smell in a long time. The coffee comes out rich and thick. For those of you that use cream or milk, you will still have a decent coffee flavor after the addition.

The pot itself is a fairly simple device. I am sure there is a micro-processor thermostat under the black base, but still a simple device. All parts are Stainless Steel. The pot, the basket holder, the basket and the basket top. No plastic touches the coffee. Parts, should they become damaged for any reason are easily available from the Presto site. But with reasonable treatment these are sturdy, workable pieces of coffee brewing goodness.

The brew cycle is regulated by the amount of water in the pot. I have tried making four cup, six cup, eight cup, and ten cup batches. Following the directions that come with the pot or that area available on the Presto site will yield weaker or stronger brews according to your taste. One just has to experiment a bit to get a feel for it.

The brew cycle ends with a flourish of percing. Then the light on the front goes off. Here's what they don't tell you. Wait another minute or so till the last batch of water filters through the basket, then open the top take out the basket top and then the basket and brewpipe. Pop the top back on. The coffee will stay hot for as long as you leave the pot plugged in. And at a good hot temp, too.

This holding part of the cycle is a double edged sword. Coffee definitely looses its full flavor after a while, but the coffee will stay hot for as long as the pot is plugged in. I recommend making several smaller batches over the day rather than just brewing a big one. That hassle aside, I haven't yet let the pot burn with no coffee in it.

All in all, this Presto pot brews a great cup of coffee in batches from four to twelve cups. Best purchase to my quality of life I have made in some time. Highly recommended.

1/27/2014--The Presto 02811 still percing away! I have experimented with different coffee grinds and techniques. Now finers grinds flow through the basket holes leaving considerable sediment in the pot. More coarse grinds don't, BUT you either have to use more coffee to get full flavor or find a way to extend the brew.....Here's my solution. I grind my medium roasted beans one notch before the coarsest setting on the grocery grinder. This results in very little sediment in the coffee pot after brewing. I will put six tablespoons of ground coffee into the basket. Then I get the pot, add the brewing tube, and fill the pot with ice from my freezer to the eight cup mark. Then I get filtered chilled water from my fridge dispenser and also fill the pot with water to the eight cup mark. Now add the covered basket to the pot, snap on the pot cover, and plug it in. This tastes really good to me when it is done, though it takes a bit longer in the brewing.",G. Burnell,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de febrero de 2009
"Finally! Hot, smooth coffee! (Presto 02811 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffeemaker)","5,0 de 5 estrellas","Ok, I normally don't do reviews but when our Krups thermal drip coffee maker died a couple of weeks ago, followed by a time-consuming and not-just-a-little-bit annoying process of trying to find a new one, the reviews we read during that process were extremely helpful in figuring out what we were going to do, so I decided to do my part also.

Our Krups lasted a good 6 years and made decent coffee but the last several weeks before it died, we started noticing that the coffee wasn't hot...actually, not even drinkable. We had to microwave just to get it hot enough to drink. Also, even though we used filtered water and cleaned it regularly, drip coffee makers are just prone to mold after awhile. We started noticing a strong mold smell in the water well and eventually, even our coffee started to carry the smell. When we started looking for a new one, we made a short but critical list: 1)coffee needs to be hot (not requiring any microwaving), 2)it needs to be smooth, not bitter, 3) and it needs to be strong.

In order to avoid the bitter, we thought about going with another thermal one to avoid that burned taste that comes with sitting on a warming plate. But going with a thermal means coffee won't be very hot at all. Argh. I was about to give up when out of the blue, I remembered house-sitting for some people years ago who had a Presto Percolator like this one. It made the best coffee I had ever tasted, but for some reason, I had totally forgotten about it. So, I started searching on Amazon and found this one, and after reading all the reviews decided this was exactly what we needed.

We've had it a week, and I am thrilled! Our coffee is hot...we're talking ""let it cool down first"" hot! And it's so smooth...not at all bitter. And here's the best part: the basket doesn't hold as much coffee as our drip filter did so the first day I made coffee, I could only use 6 scoops of coffee, instead of my regular 8. I was concerned that it would be watery-what's-the-point coffee but it wasn't! It was fabulous...as strong as we normally drink it. So, now I can use less coffee and still have it as strong as we like it.

The only issue someone might have with this is the issue with grounds in your coffee. I have two suggestions: use a filter (we use the regular 4-cup basket filters and push a little hole through the center) and use a little strainer as you pour your coffee into your cup. I bought a 50 cent strainer that looks like a big spoon and place it over the mouth of my cup as I pour; there are usually a few grounds that escape the filter and the strainer catches those.

If you don't want to mess with the possibility of a few grounds in your coffee, or if you want to be able to program your coffee to start in the morning, this may not be the coffee maker for you. But if you want really hot, very smooth yet still able to be strong coffee, you will not be sorry you bought this. Also, because it's just a stainless steel carafe and all of the parts are washable, there are not mold issues either! We love it.",Girlieschmoo,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de febrero de 2010

"An okay percolator, but majorly inconsistent with coffee strength and too hot to use around kids","1,0 de 5 estrellas","After moving to a new house with limited counter space, my old larger premium coffee maker started to malfunction. So I decided to replace it with something smaller - this percolator - which takes up much less counter space and is highly rated.

Sadly to say, I'm disappointed in the purchase and will be looking for a replacement.

Two major issues:
1. I never know if the coffee it makes will be weak or tasty. I like my coffee strong..all the time. But with this one, I can use literally the same amount of coffee, ground precisely the same, with the same amount of water, tamped down as they recommend (all instructions followed to the letter)...and it may or may not be drinkable. Yesterday for example, it came out looking like tainted water and NOT coffee. This has happened 3-4 times since I bought it in early 2023. Other days, it might be strong, might be okay, or might be really weak. It's a daily guess as to what I should expect. I HATE weak coffee, so if you're like me, buy something else.
2. It get extremely hot on the exterior while plugged in. My son didn't realize it was on the other day and he pushed it back to use the counter, and we had to treat a minor burn on his hand. Of course, if you are in a household where kids are not around, that's not nearly as big of a big deal. If you have littles, get something safer or put it where they can't reach at all. I recommend the manufacturer consider a more obvious location for the ""on"" light"" or add one on both sides because it is easy to overlook in full daylight.

UPDATE: It got worse over time and now makes bad coffee almost every pot. I'd avoid this one and buy another type of coffee maker if you don't like weak, acidic coffee.",Tommy Landry,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de mayo de 2023
Extremely Disapointed- Buyer Beware...Seriously Don't Make the Same Mistake I Did.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Ok so I purchased this pot back in October 2012 to replace a Farberware that had kicked the bucket. The pot arrived and worked as advertised in fact it worked so well that I was actually contemplating buying three more as gifts for friends until Thanksgiving day hit. Our percolator gets used two days out of the week and is only turned on for approximately 2 hours in the morning each of those two days. On Thanksgiving we brewed two pots of coffee for the family and it was only on long enough to brew those two pots. The next morning when I decided to brew a pot I noticed that it wasn't making its usual robust ""pop"" noise and just moved on until I poured my first cup. The coffee was luke warm and near tasteless. Thinking that it must have been a fluke I just went about my day and turned the pot off, dumped the pot out and rinsed it out as usual. Fast forward to Christmas and we used it back to back again on Christmas morning this time we brewed 4 pots instead of 2. By pot #3 it was weak and cold, pot #4 never brewed. I was pissed...really pissed. I take care of my stuff and this coffee pot was basically new having only been used on a handful of weekends. From then on I have had hit or miss pots of coffee with increasing frequency of a bad pot until this past weekend ...the pot is completely dead. When you put water in the pot and plug it in the light turns red after about 5 minutes to indicate that the coffee is ready...except that no brewing has occurred.

What else am I supposed to do here? Take a loss of 50 bucks and move on or pay to ship it back, and pay the restocking fee which in the end will only yield me about 35 bucks of money returned if even that?

This pot works great at the onset but peters out quickly there after. I read the reviews prior to buying and knew it was risk, amazon obviously knows it is a piece of junk because of the return policy that it retains, and most everyone else noted that their experience was similar.

Coffee Maker Has Gone Downhill,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","The first one of these coffeemakers was given to me by my mother in law 8 or 9 years ago and it was an amazing percolator. You could hear it perking from anywhere in the house. It make HOT coffee that was nice and strong or not, depending on how much grounds you used, perked 12 cups in around 15 minutes...it was awesome until one morning, it just stopped working and that was it. Less than two years ago, I replaced it with the exact same model, but it just wasn't quite the same. Didn't really make a noise when it perked, took longer to perk, coffee still tasted good, but wasn't as hot. Almost two years to the day of my purchase, it died!

Well, I thought I'd take a chance and replace it with the same so once more, I ordered another and got it last month. It came, I filled it with plain water to clean it, it perked really hard, got really hot, perked quickly, I thought ""Oh boy! We're back in business!!"" WRONG! The minute I put grounds in the basket, the same thing happens. No perking, no sound of perking, weak coffee, and it takes half an hour for the red light to indicate it's done. Today, after half an hour, the red light came on, then went off, then it actually did start perking. Don't buy this pot. They've ruined the design somehow and it's gone downhill. Not worth the money anymore. I'm on a well with a water softener and don't want a pot with an internal pump. I want something where I can clean all the parts, but this pot is not it. I can't tell you how disappointed I am that a once perfect pot is no more.",nightsmusic,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de febrero de 2023
Really nice Percolator - Until it stopped working,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Loved this percolator - makes great coffee, quick to perk, perfect cup size for me. Was loving this perker until one day - almost a year to the day I bought it - it stopped working. I faithfully cleaned the perker well every week and never got the pot base wet. But one day it just quit working. I jiggled the cord and it began to perk. This worked okay for a couple days then nothing. I'm ordering a new cord but I'm not optimistic. Very disappointed and can not recommend due to quality of manufacture.
This is an update 2 weeks after I wrote this review. I upped the rating from 1 to 2. I had to order a replacement power cord for a total of $18.65 with shipping and now it works again. I really like the coffee pot but the cord shouldn't have failed after a year and it shouldn't have been this expensive to replace it. But at least it's working for now.
This is an update from several months later. The pot completely quit working. Plugged it in one morning, the orange light immediately came on but it wouldn't perk. Between the cost of the pot and cable, this is a HUGE rip off. What a piece of garbage and I would not buy.

Cheap and flimsy,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this to replace a Cuisinart percolator with a heating element that went bad. Upon unwrapping, I noticed small chips in the plastic of the pot and lid handles. The Presto pot is lightweight and flimsy, much less substantial than the Cuisinart was, and the stainless steel is very thin. The powercord is also very thin and light and only a 2-prong instead of a 3.

The first few times I used this pot, the coffee was terrible and full of grounds. I finally realized the basket lid is so thin and light that the force of the perking coffee was lifting it, allowing the grounds to escape into the coffee. Luckily my husband had not yet disposed of our old percolator. He replaced the basket, stem, and basket lid that came with this pot with the old ones from the Cuisinart pot and it worked. The basket lid was slightly heavier- enough to keep it down during perking and the coffee is now fine and free of grounds. The old basket is more convenient, too, because the Presto basket does not have fill levels marked on it, making measuring necessary, but the Cuisinart basket does.

Another issue is that it takes a really long time to make a pot of coffee. About 20 minutes for 10-12 cups, and only a couple of minutes less for 8 cups.

The reason I did not buy another Cuisinart is that I was unhappy with the one I had only lasting a little over a year before the heating element burned out. I only make coffee at home once or twice a week, but when I do, I leave it plugged in for 3-4 hours so I can grab a hot cup while I'm working. My percolators do not get what I consider to be heavy use and I thought it should have lasted longer than it did. But the next time the coffee pot goes, I will probably go back to Cuisinart. I'm very unhappy with the cheap quality of the Presto. I bought it because I was under the impression that because the company was in the United States it would not be a cheap piece of junk made in China, like so many of the other percolator reviews indicated. However, on the bottom of the pot, right under where it says ""National Presto Ind., Inc., Eau Claire, WI"", it also says ""Made In China."" I wasn't happy with the lifespan of the Cuisinart but I'd be shocked to get that long out of this pot. I definitely do not recommend the Presto, unless you have a way to keep the basket lid down so you don't have to drink sludge.",Sister Renee Pittelli,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de marzo de 2010

UPDATE: THREE YEARS IN (and down to one star),"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This will be almost three years we've had this pot and by now I'm ready to toss it. It used to make a pretty decent cup of coffee. Now it's beyond horrid. I know it wasn't an expensive pot (it was $30 when I bought it) but I'll be a nutter if I'm going to spend $50 on a new one that most likely won't last any longer. I love coffee out of a percolator but the experiences I've had (this is two different pots from different companies have done the same thing) has me going back to a drip system.

BOO Presto! BOO!

I've had this pot for going on two years now

Pros:
- It makes a pretty good cup of coffee.
- It can usually go three or four pots before it gets dirty enough to need a good cleaning (spout & stem)

Cons:
- a 12-cup pot SHOULD hold 12 measured liquid cups, as in 96 ounces because that is 12 liquid cups!. To start with, it only holds 8 measured liquid cups (used my old Pyrex four-cup measurer for this). The grounds soak up their share and the air gets a fair bit of moisture through evaporation. If everyone around here carefully measures their coffee there's enough brew to fill seven-and-a-half cups. If not, someone invariably gets shorted an entire cup.

- Someone here says ""don't scrub the inside"". Oh, that is so wrong! In the bottom is the heating thing and it's not stainless steel and it WILL corrode in very short order and when it does the coffee tastes horrid. Inside the spout and stem will also build up residue eventually that will ruin the flavor of your coffee.

Other thoughts: When it comes to cleaning we occasionally like to percolate a pot of fresh water with a little mild dish detergent (you don't want to use vinegar because that metal heating thing in the bottom that isn't stainless) in it (still have to hand-clean the spout and stem, though) but afterward we could still taste soap so I gave Seventh Generation Dish Liquid, Free & Clear, 25 oz and there's no soapy flavor afterward.",Periwinkle,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de febrero de 2018
So disappointed,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I Purchased my presto, five months ago, and have been incredibly happy with it until this week. It has stopped percolating. The water gets hot however, it does not reach the grounds to brew the coffee. I troubleshot the issue based on recommendations online, including descaling, however, the problem is still occurring. I telephoned customer service at which point they asked for photographs of the unit. I provided all photographs as requested and their response was “your unit looks great. Very clean.” Yes, I know. The agent then stated that I could mail my pot to them and they would happily inspect it. At which point I asked, what am I supposed to do for coffee in the meantime….? I threw away my old pot when this one arrived I do not have a back up plan nor did I expect need one with what I thought was a quality purchase. Their response was “You can buy yourself a different coffee maker until we inspect yours and it is returned to you (about 2-3 weeks) or you can go to the local gas station and buy your coffee there”.

Wow. Just wow. I would not buy this product again seeing as it only lasted five months, and the expectation from the manufacturer is that I should invest in some thing else until they figure out what went wrong.",michelle warnke,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de julio de 2023
Can not get it to work.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","First, I have used a coffee perk for years. This one is full on frustrating. My 1st pot obviously did not perk properly as the water was still clear at the end. I have continued to try and keep getting very weak coffee. I grind the beans and fill the basket. Tried a different coffee. The issue appears to be the perk straw must close during each perk. I tried running ot with a glass over the straw so i could see. During the 10 minutes only about 4 of the perks got water through. Any suggestions? Thanks",Deb May,Revisado en Canadá el 24 de diciembre de 2023

Not Impressed At All,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Don't waste your money on this one! I've always used percolater coffeemakers and I'm a fan of the wonderful coffee they brew, however, my coffeemaker quit working and based on good reviews I decided to try this Presto coffemaker. I'm not impressed at all, in fact it makes terrible weak coffee. Right out of the box I noticed many negative things. The cord is way to short, the construction of the entire pot is made from very thin and cheaply constructed steel. The cheap-o basket lid which doesn't rest firmly on the basket allows the coffee grinds to spill over into the coffee maker. I know it's overflow, because the basket has super tiny holes that barely even lets water pass through, so I know grinds wouldn't. In fact, the holes are so small that they clog up everytime we've used it, and that's using specially ground coffee for percolators. I like a STRONG cup of coffee, so when I put enough coffee in the basket to get the right brew strength, grinds overflow the basket every single time. Yes, I've tried using the filters it came with, but the coffee turned out even weaker than before, so I had to pour that pot of coffee down the drain. So far I haven't been able to make a decent cup of coffee with this thing, it comes out super weak every time, no matter how I adjust the coffee to water ratio. My family and friends have always said that I make the best coffee they've ever had, and I have to say that I can make a great cup of coffee, so experience isn't the issue. I'm convinced that the basket is the entire culprit of the weak coffee it produces. So to anyone considering purchasing this coffemaker, I'd say definitely don't do it. To everyone who posted great reviews on this maker, all I can say is that they must love weak coffee. I feel I've wasted $40.00, and I'm definitely going to send this Presto Coffemaker back. Any recommendations out there for a really great high quality constructed percolater? preferrably one with some longevity of life.",Jazminjo,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de abril de 2011
A Brew Short Lived is a Morning Unfulfilled,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Delivered 6-1-20; dead by 6-30-20. I read a couple other reviews saying theirs died, but I thought ‘its a fluke and there will always be a few faulty units’. Mine is clearly a faulty unit.

Pros: Makes coffee fast and cleaning is easy. The stainless is nice. The chrome finish always looks beautiful and wipes clean easily. Doesn’t scratch very easily. Good flavor when it brews properly. Stays hot until you unplug it, coffee is perfect temp.

Cons: No ON/OFF switch. No “ON” indicator, you just wait to hear the boiling start. Sometimes brews an entire pot of hot water. Coffee strength varies A LOT, even if you use the same amount of coffee. I’m very particular about coffee measuring by brand and grind, it was definitely the pot. Minerals and coffee particulate deposit on the bottom element where I think it might be aluminum. Scrub that area well every use.

Coffee pot has to be cool to make another pot.

DEATH of a Percolator:
One day I put it on, and heard it start to heat up but never heard the (VERY) loud thump it makes as it forces water up to the basket. (Literally sounds like the whole thing does a little hop off the counter.) When I checked: the light was on to tell me brewing cycle was complete. There was no coffee but the was warm, not hot, and the basket of grind was dry. ☹️

I’ve tried 4 times, the light stays on and tells the coffee pot it’s brew cycle is done. So it won’t make coffee, anymore. Is dead. 💀 ☕️

Tragic.

Not All Stainless Steel,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I’ve owned this percolator for a little over 2 weeks. I keep it clean. This morning I made a pot of coffee as usual. But what was highly disturbing was the fact that this product is touted on this site as being all stainless steel fabrication. It is not. The well in the bottom of the pot turned black. That would indicate anodized aluminum! It turned my stomach. Aluminum is toxic when ingested. So disappointed. This should be against the law. I’m sensitive so I’m taking charcoal pills to clean my organs from aluminum consumption. I would imagine that all electric percolators have an aluminum well because the aluminum heats the beverages up quicker. So, they need to state that in the product description!",Jade,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de febrero de 2024
Get the square holed filters and its perfect!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Wanted to remove boiling coffee in plastic and toxic potentials of ol' Mr Coffee machine and move to stainless steel...much hotter coffee with percolator Presto vs drip style Mr. Coffee...also tastes better...purchase of 5-hole coffee filter liners makes cleanup easy, has a short learning curve and much healthier outcome over heating plastics in your coffee...Sorry I didn't do this years ago!
edit update 10 months later: after reading reviews of people who have owned Presto or Faberware style older percolator electric coffee makers for decades and believing I would have similar expectations (even my Mr. Coffee drip versions never failed after years of use) my Presto electric percolator 12-cup that I use daily and keep on for typically 2 hours per use developed a leak at the spout which appears to be welded on...the enclosed picture illustrates a rusted section on the lower left side of the spout that occurred at the 10 month post purchase/use where the leaking comes from.

Sparks and FIRE - As expected From MORE CHINESE GARBAGE!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Like everything else made in China, I just wait to see when it blows out, blows up, implodes, melts down, or shatters into worthless pieces. This particular piece of GARBAGE FROM CHINA, made it, exactly one month - post warranty. Then one morning, it decided to literally, blow up. Throwing sparks all the way across the counter and starting the rack of paper towels on fire. Fortunately for Presto, I'm not all too excited about suing, but we're giving it some serious thought.
Incredibly, it didn't pop a working 20 amp breaker until the fireworks and damage were done. Had we not been waiting for the coffee, there's no doubt the house would have burned to the ground, as the paper towel rack was hanging under a wooden cupboards like most people's.

Aside from that wonderful CHINESE MADE experience, it was working great for 12 months and 29 days. It whips out 12 cups of coffee lickety split. You do NOT need filters, that was our first mistake, reading all these people worried about filters was an unnecessary ordeal? We used the same exact Folgers coffee off the shelf as we did the drip. No grounds get through.
But of course, that's all beside the point now. And seeing as how there's no longer a United States made, electric percolator (that we've found) it looks like we'll check into a stove top perk-er.
It appears the cause of this is a poor quality base material. After the fire, removing the base, removing all the wires to the plug assembly, there was a direct short, inside the base betwixt the two neutral and hot prongs, as this is not a grounded unit. A simple ohm meter revealed this, which means, somehow, the base material, degrades and becomes conducive for electricity, as there was no visible, outside conducting material anywhere - hence, the base material itself was creating the direct short?

"NOT all stainless steel! Per Presto's customer service, this percolator has an aluminum 'well'.","1,0 de 5 estrellas","I have never written a product review until now. This product is NOT all stainless steel but you have to call Presto to find that out. The 'well' that the perk tube sits in and feeds hot water into is aluminum. If you are trying to find a plastic free AND aluminum free coffee maker, this is not it. I called both Presto and Amazon to ask that they disclose all of the materials that touch the coffee in their product information (which is clearly really important to some people!).
I have no confidence that either company will do this, thus this review.

The research I've done on the effects of aluminum in the diet on human health is conflicting. The best information I've found is that there is no definitive information regarding the impact aluminum has on human heath. Information seems to fall into several extreme camps...

(I'm simplifying after hours of research...a Washington Post article on aluminum in products by Gisela Telis sums up some of the conflicting information)

1.aluminum in the diet is a problem to be concerned about

2.it's not a problem to be concerned about

or

3.there is just not enough information to know whether or not it's a problem to be concerned about.

I have attempted to eliminate toxins from my family's diet that I am aware of and concerned about.
It is not too much to ask for full disclosure regarding all of the materials used in the construction of cookware so that the customer is able to make a more informed decision.
My intent in this review is to inform, not to scare. That being said, I watched my dear mother in law wither over 7 years with Alzheimer's. While I'd rather not be concerned about any of this stuff, I feel that, until there is more information about the effects of aluminum in the diet, I'd rather be safe than sorry.",Deborah McDonald,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de enero de 2015

The messiest percolator that I have ever experienced,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I have used percolators since my parents let me drink coffee, and I am 74 years old. This thing is a piece of crap in that many of the coffee grounds most often end up on top of the percolator basket. I use it every day of the week and it seems like this pot is super-sensitive about the line voltage or something. Why do I say that? Because sometimes it perks very fast and other times not so fast. On the mornings when it perks fast there are a lot of grounds on top of the basket, and a lot of grounds in the coffee itself. On the mornings when it perks more slowly this does not happen. My theory for what is happening is that with higher voltage - coming through the electrical outlet, something I have no control over - and the faster perking that the water cannot drain through the top of the basket quickly enough and somehow, the grounds end up overflowing the basket. When the voltage is lower (again, my theory) it perks more slowly and the water can drain back through the basket in enough time so that it does not overflow. Color me super disappointed.",Daniel H.

Coffee lovers beware. Worst percolator I have ever owned.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I have owned several electric percolators over the years and I can honestly say that this is the worst I have ever owned. I am not talking about the quality of the machine but of the flavour of the coffee.

They boast that it can make a pot in as little as a minute a cup and it does do that, which I think is the problem. Any of my previous percolators that I have owned have taken much longer to brew a pot than this one but they also made a much richer cup of coffee.

It sounds like it is working and the light brightens to indicate it is ready but when you go to pour the coffee, it comes out as hot water. The stainless tube that holds the basket is not clogged, but for some reason the water is not going up this tube and dispersing onto the basket. Tried it twice this morning to no avail! I ended up sitting the basket in a pot and pouring the hot water over it. When it didn't work the first time, we checked everything. Nothing seemed wrong.

"Not 100% stainless steel, contains aluminum parts in tub.","1,0 de 5 estrellas","This was my first coffee percolator (first bought in December 2012) And it worked great until it died in December of 2016. The reason I purchased this unit again was because of the original reviews about no aluminum inside the tub. Second one arrived with an aluminum nut at the bottom of the tub, did not like that but had no choice and I decided to run with it. Now it’s making loud noises while keeping the coffee hot so from past experience I decided to buy another unit (not this brand) as a back up just in case this one failed. After reading the reviews on this unit again I noticed more and more people are concerned with the aluminum as I was and still am. Just bought a Hamilton Beach 40616 percolator that is supposed to be 100% stainless steel on the inside from Amazon.

Yet another cursed percolator.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this Presto in June of 2015 (I write this on November 4, 2016). Last week I started to get only slightly tinted warm water after brewing, and the 'ready' light went out prematurely. It worked fine again until this week; on Monday, 'coffee water' again. Then, for three days, it was fine. Today, nothing. I did write to the company after the Monday incident, and have not heard back, so I'm back on Amazon looking for another brand that I haven't tried. This is harder than it looks, since I have had similar problems with both Oneida and Farberware electric percolators, with each doing essentially the same thing at roughly the two year mark, if not sooner. Still, I'm not giving up hope, since I like perked coffee, in large part because I like my coffee hot. But these poorly made products are not good for our pocketbooks, or for the landfill, since the heating element apparently can't be fixed. This is the same problem I had with the other two brands, and I now wonder if they don't all get their heating elements from the same place in China, then just change the rest of the pot to suit their brand. I have just ordered a stovetop percolator-fool me once, shame on me, fool me three times--well, you know.

5-Star Coffee and 0-Star Cleaning Design,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this pot after becoming disgusted with warm, stale, plastic-tasting coffee produced by automatic drip makers. Plus, I live in the mountains where any hint of lightning zapped pot after pot. Remembering how perfectly our old percolators worked, I bought this one. Based others' reviews, I use 3.5 inch disk filters and have had no problems with grounds in the coffee or basket holes. To solve the flaw of no-timer, I bought a simple mechanical plug-in timer designed for appliances with heating elements (about $ 10.00).
The other flaw is serious, perhaps dangerous, and is causing me to replace this pot -- although it is working perfectly after four years. The spout is virtually impossible to clean. It is not completely open to the pot. Visualize the oval opening cut in half. The top half is closed off. With the spout so narrow and curved it is impossible to clean from the outside or the inside. I never expected this by looking at the photo. As another reviewer has mentioned, this collects gunk. You can't clean it with dynamite. I've tried a variety of brushes and cloths and cleaning solutions -- including hot full strength vinegar overnight. I cleaned the pot regularly, but did not realize I was not reaching the problem area for a while. Now I attempt to clean it every day, but the gunk (sticky black coffee oil, like tar)defeats my best efforts. I bought this pot to be safe from toxins in plastic and other materials. Now I'm dealing with whatever microbes lurk in this warm, dark, uncleanable space. I am looking for a replacement with a short, fully opened spout.

We purchased this percolator last week from Amazon. It was listed as in new/unused condition meaning, possibly an open box or the box itself was damaged. The exact Amazon description for it was: Condition: Used - Like New - Item is in original packaging, but packaging has damage.

Obviously for items described like this, the product is priced at a reduced cost compared to buying a new one. The description makes it sound like everything is just fine and dandy with the percolator. Unfortunately….it's not. it arrived today. The box was absolutely fine, no damage however, but it did not contain the detachable power cord. The coffee maker is worthless without the cord so I had to run to the hardware store and for $4.99, buy a power cord that fits the coffee maker. I would've returned the coffee maker, but it's not worth the hassle. Somebody at Amazon did not do their job and did not inspect the contents before just assuming that the coffee maker was complete and ready to be sold as if new again. Shame on Amazon!

Excellent customer service, though. I contacted Presto and was sent a new percolator! I did not even have to send the defective one back. The customer service rep said that it sounded like ours had a bad thermostat. The replacement received the same consistent good care and use. It worked well for about 6 weeks. Then it started working inconsistently. Great coffee one day, weak and watery the next. Again, the amount of ground coffee, water, and water temperature were consistent.

Bad Design - Buy Something Else,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","The new Presto 12 cup Stainless Steel Coffee Makers have a design flaw. They changed the locking nut that holds the heating element in place inside the basin to some other metal that is not stainless steel. It used to be stainless steel.

This is bad because the nut will corrode very quickly given the proximity of heat, electricity, and contact with differing metals. The corrosion puts metal oxide of some kind into the water being heated and makes it taste metallic. I filled and heated it 5 times to try and get the taste out, but it just got worse and the nut went from pristine to pock marked with corrosion in just a couple hours. Not the red rust color of iron and steel corrosion. It was white/grey much like aluminum oxide.

After finding out, first, that the pot is Not all stainless steel, the part where you insert the stem on the bottom is aluminum, and turns black. You can ruin some dishcloths trying to clean it out, but it's almost impossible.
The coffeepot made hot coffee that stayed hot, in the beginning. Now, it does not, and as soon as you pour your cup, the light goes out. I thought maybe it was my outlets, but the outlets work fine with everything else. The cord is tight to the pot, but if you jiggle it, the light goes out, too.
Finally, the worst part is that sometimes the coffee pot will not perk at all, so you play the game of plugging it into another outlet, jiggling the cord and doing it all over again. After 5 or 6 tries, if you're lucky, you will get perked coffee.

not as good as I thought,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I thought this was a good coffee pot with good customer service, well I bought this coffee pot in Jan. 2022 (7) months ago, the plug suddenly became loose (my wife actually got burnt by the plug) so I bought a new plug, well when the new plug arrived it fit the same way as the old plug, this is when I realized that the prongs in the pot were rusted. So, I called Presto and they told me it's still under warranty and they just need the receipt. I sent the receipt and now they want pictures and of course the serial number which was already given to them in which I'm now told that "" they would try to help me"". It makes a good cup of coffee, however, only for 7 months.

Returned After Opening Box,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",Turns out the basket wasn't stainless steel. Magnets didn't stick to it so I believe it is aluminum.

Never will I recommend this product again!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","It is horrible....I bought one in 2003 and it finally quit working so replaced with an identical. Now I need to get another coffee pot because this one is sooooooo bad. I used the liners that were sent with it but because they were so messy and made the coffee bad testing, I quit using them. The coffee basket does not seal properly so I have grounds in the bottom of my pot always, which I did not have with the old one. It seems that the brewing time is shorter (?) because the coffee is not as good as with the old pot.",Nana,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de abril de 2023
Disappointed,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Ugh I wanted to love this so badly I read so many review and tried and tried but no matter what I did it would stop perking before it was done. Always watery. I even tried letting the water run for twenty minutes to get it super cold I’ve filled the basket with grinds to the top no mater what the coffee comes out so weak I may as well be drinking hot water

Update I managed to figure it out with out the filter but then it just quite on me

Requires lots of maintenance to keep brewing,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this in June this year. Worked great for about 4 months. Now coffee is more like tea. I found through others reviews that the seat for the perculator tube was probably the issue. I cleaned this thoroughly with soap and water...no help. Brewed with baking soda which pulled a ton of oils out, but coffee still not good. Finally attached a green scothbright pad to my drill and polished the aluminum seat for the perk tube. It made good coffee again...for about three days. Now if I don't constantly work the seat with scothbright it just won't perk anything up to the basket.

So, based on other reviews, Presto is correct, it is user error and the perk tube isn't seated correctly. What they aren't saying is you need a half hour every morning and lots of elbow grease to clean the aluminum heating well or your just gonna get brown tinted water....

EXTREME POOR QUALITY,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Too many defects on this product:
- Water level is not visible on the pot, even though manual says it shows in the inside handle. Hence you can never calibrate the amount of water you are using to brew the exact no of cups of coffee.
- Material is sharp metal and needs care when cleaning at the risk of getting cuts and wounds.
-The entire process to brew the coffee from filling water in the pot, pouring coffee in the filter, closing the lid and positioning the water pipe in the right position at the bottom of the kettle is a complete hassle.",IROKO,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de enero de 2023
Black Residue on Heating Element,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","We have used this coffee pot about 5x week since purchasing. We’ve enjoyed it and wanted to move away from a plastic coffee maker.

However, while we followed manufacturer’s recommendation for cleaning with dish detergent, it appears to have rust or other metallic residue. Today for the first time I checked with a paper towel after cleaning and noticed the residue despite the rest of the percolator being spotless. See photo. I suspect it is the one part that is not stainless steel and over time it will degrade.

After testing to make sure it wasn’t outlet I’ve come to the conclusion my poor percolator has seen the end of life. Not happy about that. I love how hot and yummy my coffee is with the percolator.

Doesn't Last,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I love fresh perked coffee. I make it every morning. After years with the same Farberware pot, it finally died. I replaced it with a new Farberware pot. (One that was now made in China since they moved their production there from New York) That lasted less than six months. The coffee would be extremely weak and not very hot. I replaced it with another Farberware. Same thing. In six months it was making luke warm dishwater.

I read a bunch of reviews and the Presto was rated highly so I gave up on the Farberware and ordered a Presto. I've had the Presto for about six months and guess what? It's making dishwater. I fill the basket to the brim and it is the weakest coffee ever. I may just go back to a stove top model and forget the electric perk pots.

DISAPPOINTED ~ Presto Percolator Coffee Maker stopped working after barely a week! :((,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","After reading many more positive customer reviews than negative ones, I took a chance and ordered the Presto Stainless Steel percolator coffee pot. It arrived on March 20, 2021 and I commenced using it the next morning. Right off, I noticed that it never turned itself off after a couple of hours (isn't it supposed to?). Regardless, I decided that I'd go ahead and keep it, and just make sure to remember to unplug it so it wouldn't keep cooking the coffee. Well, this afternoon, barely 7 days after I got it, I thought we'd enjoy a cup of fresh coffee with New York style cheesecake after dinner, so I made the preparations for a fresh pot of coffee, and plugged it in....

The light came on as soon as it was plugged in and it would not work. After contacting the manufacturer in Wisconsin we were told that because the coffee pot was not CUL certified, they were unable to send any repair parts to Canada.

Not what I expected,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this coffee pot because I wanted a full-bodied, hot cup of coffee that my mom's percolator made years ago. I was sorely disappointed. The stem doesn't fit properly into the hole on the bottom of the pot, so as a result, it hops up and down with each perk, causing the basket to hop as well, and the grinds go all over and fall back into the coffee. I tried using the filters that completely encase the grinds, but that still produced grinds in the coffee, and the coffee produced was weak and tasteless. I am very upset that I spent so much on a coffee pot that doesn't do what it is supposed to do. I like that it is stainless steel and looks nice, but that is about it. I tried using different filters and different coffee grinds, thinking that I would give it a fair try, and now I can't even return it because it is past the 30 day return policy, so I'm stuck with it.

If you wiped it with a dry paper towel in the bottom where the stem fits in, black metal residue came off. We did not want to be drinking that. Is that toxic? We should have sent it back, but we just got rid of it. They need to use better non-reactive metal parts where the heating elements connect.

This seemed like the best choice of the percolators offered by Amazon ...,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This seemed like the best choice of the percolators offered by Amazon - highest rated and so many positive reviews, but I HATE this machine and sadly we are one week past Amazon's 30-day purchase guarantee. I wish I had read the one star reviews. The problems described by purchasers most recently are the exact problems we are having. It is impossible to get the tube to stay in the well at the bottom of the pot. It just kind of balances there. You basically have to hold your breath and say a prayer as you put the lid on every morning - hope and pray that the tube stays exactly in place and no matter how well you think it is in there, you end up with a disappointing pot of brown water. This is not operator error - this is poor design and/or defective (does it heat enough?).

So why did you give it 5-stars, Merréll? Because the coffee it makes is SUPERIOR to the ""coffee maker"" variety.

First off, that no timer thing? That's a BFD! No timer and, I almost came home to a house fire. All you need do is forget it's plugged in, you get called away and BAM! House fire. NOT worth the RISK.
Secondly, the damn thing is sitting BROKEN on my counter right now. I was so happy to get home delivery purified water service. What great coffee that will make, right?

Weak and flavorless coffee is all you will get with this Percolator.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I thought the idea of having a percolator would be a nice addition to all of my other kitchen appliances. I recently began buying fresh teas that I can brew myself but this machine is a big disappointment. It is attractive looking and sturdy but produces every single batch of coffee or tea like a watered down flavorless version of the real thing. It does this without failure. It won't matter how much coffee you add, or if it's ground at home or not, this percolator just does not work. I tried all levels of water and input of coffee or tea. The only thing this is good for is heating water to make tea, or to sterilize water. I do not recommend it unless you enjoy awfully weak and watered down versions of your morning drinks. You will be very disappointed, especially since the machine itself is so attractive.

If you like inconsistent and weak coffee...this is the pot for you.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","The pot appears well made, but the results do not match. The coffee quality is inconsistent and many times very weak. I researched the issue and implemented the recommendations Presto has from using more coffee to putting ice in the water to cool it down before turning the unit on. Unfortunately none yielded the desirable results. It was a surprise each morning what quality coffee you are going to get.

At that price, the unit should allow the user to control the strength of the coffee by determining how long to let it percolate before it stops. Unfortunately this unit does not have this feature. I spoke with Presto and returned the unit to them only to be told that it works fine. They offered a credit of less than half what we paid for the unit, and we've only used it for 3 months.

"Brews quick, not very strong coffee","1,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this coffee maker after my last one died based on the reviews. Sadly I was very disappointed. No matter how I brewed the coffee, I could not get it to brew a strong pot. Finally figured out the drain holes in the bottom were too small to use with a filter and the basket would fill up and water would run over the top down into the pot. I ended up drilling bigger holes in the basket to make it flow better. It solved the problem, but I don’t think it should be my responsibility to re-engineer a new product. My last percolator had basket holes similar to the ones on the lid of this product and worked great.

I use the amount of coffee grounds for a 12 cup pot, and it's finished perking in 12 minutes every time. Then I
add the amount of water that I would of put in the pot for 12 cups. It tastes just as good!
I use the cheaper small round filter, wet it first before I put in the grounds.
Before when I tried to go with the 12 cups, I think the thermostat perked it longer, and stronger that's why it overflowed the grounds into the pot.",Patricia V.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de septiembre de 2019

I noticed that the perk tube does not sit in the perk well, it seems to be too big so just sits on top of it. The Farberware percolator’s perk tube actually sat in the perk well so I’m wondering if that’s the issue with this Presto.

Review Update,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","For the longest time I've been using a drip coffee maker and one of the better ones at that and I've been saying for years that I miss the old electric percolators and I finally bought a Presto and I'm so glad I did. It's been a very long time since I've enjoyed a morning cup of French roast as good as this and I'll never go back to drip. The Presto is very well made in every way. There really is no point in having a glass top on the Presto because you have no direct control over the perk time anyway because the Presto isn't a stove top design. We grind our own beans to a finer grind probably than most folks do and to avoid spilling the ground coffee down the spout in the basket we simply drop a 1/2"" stainless 10-32 screw into the spout before pouring in the fresh grounds. Just don't forget to remove the screw before placing the lid on the pot. Also, not much grounds ends up in the bottom of the pot and I think it is because the lid that installs over the basket encourages more water to flow through the grounds because of the lids design. The cone shaped drip coffee maker with a paper filter allows too much water to bypass the coffee grounds which results in a weak cup of coffee and simply adding more grounds does not rectify the problem because more water then bypasses the grounds. For me it's the Presto percolator forever and I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. Many thanks to Presto and Amazon.

I must unfortunately amend this review. After experimenting further with this product we've decided to stay with our Cuisinart 12 cup drip coffee maker because it takes far less coffee grounds to make the same amount of finished product and even after using much more grounds to make the same amount of coffee the taste and quality still isn't near as good tasting as that produced by our drip machine. Also, cleanup must be performed after each pot of coffee which isn't easy and takes a lot of hot water time and paper towels. We're very disappointed with this percolator.",James Wilkinson,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de enero de 2024
Foul / odd smell emitting from steam at spout and same smell from suface of hot cups of coffee,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I didn't think it was fair to give this product a poor review without a detailed explanation because we have faithfully purchasing the Presto 12 cup percolator since November of 2015. Searching MY ORDERS on my Prime account we have purchased a total of 6 of these units. We go through A LOT of coffee here at our house. 6 to 8 pounds of ground coffee monthly. 3 to 5 pots a day.........6 to 12 cup brews depending upon how many we are at the time. During the Covid period I picked up two of these to have a new backups in case the supply chain was interrupted and we happened to have our working unit go down. (typically the cord connection at the unit will eventually emit a mild odor of warm plastic / wire. We've ordered a replacement cord and that worked great for another year until I got another whiff of that connection odor last week so i tossed that one out and broke out one of the two new units I had as spares. Like I usually do, I cleaned the interior of the unit and the basket parts by running a full 12 cups of filtered water through 2 cycles, then a full pot of coffee. All three batches caused a strange, metallic, odorous steam out of the spout and same very noticeable odor at the surface of the hot coffee. I figured it would go away eventually. After twos days and probably 6 pots of coffee the odor never went away. I decided to open the second new unit and ran them both with a solution of white vinegar and filtered water. After cooling I rinsed them both thoroughly and percolated 8 cups in each of pots, using the same Maxwellhouse Smooth Bold coffee grinds we use daily. Well the pot that was emitting the odor was still doing so, with no improvement whatsoever while the newest pot produced the same perfect coffee we've become accustomed to using these Presto 12 cup units. So we got one lemon out of 6 pots purchased since 2015. I'm writing this lengthy review in hopes that someone at Presto will want to have this unit returned to them so they can ""smell for themselves"" and hopefully figure out what is causing it for the purpose of not having someone else buy one of these and never buy another. For 20 years prior to 2015 we were loyal to the Fabreware 12 cup units which used to last forever. But the last couple of units we got stopped working from failure of the heating elements that we found out had become a common problem that went on for a while......so we tried Presto and we've stuck with them since then. So if you get one of these funny smelling steam emissions from your Presto spout and the hot coffee poured out of it......you'll know it's not your nose :-)",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de septiembre de 2022
Not worth the money,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this Presto percolator to replace a ten-year-old (ten!) Cuisinart perc that finally died. Shopped for another one but was a little concerned that there appear to be few new ones in stock but a lot of used ones available (is Cuisinart maybe phasing it out). Plus the Presto product was less expensive but appeared to be a close replacement. Big mistake. The grounds (whole beans ground specifically for percolator) escape from the basket and get into the water, the power cord doesn't have a three-prong grounded plug (suggesting a wimpy heating element unlikely to last long), and the lid is too tight a fit and hard to take off. Plus it came with a few weirdly folded paper filters that I'm sure aren't available at my grocery store. But why filters at all?! One of the benefits of a percolator is that you don't need a filter unless using finely-ground coffee in a pinch. I'll clean the Presto up and donate it to Goodwill while ordering another Cuisinart like I should have in the first place.",nrg,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de febrero de 2024
Saveur de café faible,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Après 4 semaines d'utilisation, je le retourne. J'ai essayé plusieurs sortes de mouture, mis plus de café pour un café riche mais lorsqu'on met 10g de café par tasse donc de mon côté 8 tasses/ 90g, une de plus pour un café goûteux, pour la famille le matin, le café passe par-dessus et se ramasse dans la cafetière. Je n'ai pas essayé de faire 12 tasses car le réservoir pour recevoir le café est trop petit et la tige centrale selon moi devrait être plus longue, c'est probablement pour cette raison que le café sort du réservoir et se retrouve dans la cafetière même si je met un filtre à disque à café dans le réceptacle. À mon avis ne pas faire plus de 8 tasses à la fois avec cette cafetière.
Par contre concernant la chaleur du café je mets un 5 étoiles.
De plus les éléments au fond ne semblent pas en acier inoxydable comme mentionné ce qui me laisse perplexe, il déteigne, change de couleur. J'ai acheté ce produit car le % de bons commentaires était plus nombreux que les négatifs mais au final, je suis déçue. Je ne lâche pas ma recherche pour me trouver un bon percolateur.
Les compagnies devraient mettre plus d'images de leurs produits que ce soit externe mais surtout l'intérieur, le matériau et les dimensions de toutes leurs composantes ainsi on ne ferait pas d'achat sans être au courant mais surtout éviter les retours qui au final se ramasse on ne sait où!!! Pas trop environnemental.
J'espère que cela permettra d'éclairer d'autres personnes avant d'acheter, malgré tout, de mon coté j'ai regardé durant 1mois et demi avant de faire l'achat.

"Started out great, then stopped.","2,0 de 5 estrellas","We have been using a percolator for years when in December our machine that was about 5 years old died.

not exactly winning awards for convenience and style,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","UPDATE: Just read that the well for the percolator is actually made of aluminum. this tipped the scales for me, and now I am returning it. and subtracting an additional star.

---

most of the reviews here are focused on a) the taste of the coffee, b) its relative functionality compared to other percolators, and c) the fact that it has no aluminum/plastic. i bought this first and foremost because it has no aluminum or plastic. but is convenience also a factor naturally. taste only matters insofar as it is at least as good as drip coffee.

i am thrilled that i have an all stainless steel coffee maker, and it does make at least drip quality coffee (if it makes better coffee than drip coffee makers, then it is lost on me [im no coffee connieseur]).

where this loses points is on convenience. it is less convenient than drip coffee for sure:

1) the base is not detachable. this would have made it super easy to lift the pot for easy filling, dishwashing etc. This is also annoying when cleaning it as the base has exposed parts that are sensitive to water which could cause electrical malfunction. so not only is it annoying it is slightly dangerous! minus 0.5 star

2) there is no on off switch! the only way to turn it off is by unplugging the darn thing! what the hark! a simple on/off switch would make it so much easier to quickly turn it on or off rather than awkwardly searching for the plug to remove from the outlet, or from the back of the percolator. For me, I had my drip coffee brewer at a high location on a stationary service cart, and the plug reached all the way down back to wall outlet. That set up was not feasible with this percolator, and therefore showed a painful lack of versatility integrating with how my kitchen was set up. minus 1 star.

3) the lid is a pain to remove; you have to pull with a bit of force, and then it will suddenly release in dramatic fashion. Additionally, the container for the grounds is sitting on a spring inside the pot, and is pressed down by the lid. So when you remove the lid (suddenly, as i mentioned), the brew container pops up and results in a little spill of coffee grounds. minus 0.5 stars

4) it is awkwardly tall, and is a bit top-heavy post-brew. in a normal coffee maker, the coffee grounds are separate from the coffee which is in a pot that you can conveniently remove from the rest of the apparatus to pour your coffee. but with this, the grounds remain in the top of the pot as you pour and it has a little bit of an awkward hold to it. Additionally, the height of this makes it a little to reach down the center to clean all the corners of the pot. minus 0.25 stars (not a *big* deal, but certainly a notable annoyance)

anyways, its may be worth the 40 bux i spent on the used amazonwarehouse version, esp since i wont be drinking plastic anymore... but at the same time they havent perfected its convenience to make it suitable for anyone to seamlessly replace drip coffee. buy this if you are ready to deal with some moderate annoyances in making your coffee every day. however, i believe one of these days a new more convenient percolator will come out and i will be ready to buy that when that happens!",Sri Vastav,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de enero de 2015
Weakest coffee and bad filters,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I don't know why there are so many very high reviews for this product. I wanted a coffee machine with no plastic parts -- this one fits that bill. However I haven't been able to brew a decent pot at all yet, the coffee when ""ready"" comes out looking like tea -- just barely any coffee in it. It gets worse: the ""fold over"" style of coffee filter are annoying to setup and use, plus the coffee is so weak you can taste the paper flavour of the filter (brand name ""Melitta"" filters).

I would not recommend this coffee machine.",Andy K,Revisado en Canadá el 26 de diciembre de 2023
Poorly manufactured quality,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","We bought this one to replace one we've had for about 10 years. The pour spout is too low on the body. Once the coffee is done you have to remove the basket or as you pour your coffee you get grounds in your cup as the coffee pours through the basket going to the pour.
Also, it perks slowly in the beginning, then as it gets close to completion the perking speeds up, then you end up with coffee all over the top of the basket as it can't filter fast enough through the coffee. I don't overfill the basket with coffee, so that isn't the issue.
It's just a poorly made product.",Cleo Mathis,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de enero de 2024
"Ok, but not great","2,0 de 5 estrellas","The coffee does turn out and stay piping hot, but the only way to get decent-tasting coffee is to use a wrap-around filter. If you don't use a wrap-around filter, the coffee will be bitter and full of grinds (even with a coarse grind). A disc filter doesn't help, either. The product is sold in Canada, but the warranty is not valid here (only in the USA). The percolator has a sleek, classic style, though the overall construction feels a bit flimsy.
Update: After using this for about 6 weeks, I can say, that unless you make a full pot, the coffee will come out tasting a bit burnt.",Jockstrap514,Revisado en Canadá el 19 de agosto de 2023
Worked great for a while,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","We purchased this percolator about two years ago and just this morning it malfunctioned and the whole house filled with the smell of an electrical fire. Upon inspection, we noticed that the plug that inserts into the bottom of the coffee maker had started to smoke and pop. It was extremely hot to the touch and appeared scalded. Not good. Thankfully we were able to locate the source of the smell quickly and unplugged the percolator before a fire started.",Lisa Marie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de enero de 2024
Failed after using for only 3 months,"2,0 de 5 estrellas",This was our third coffee pot of this make and model. We've only had it for 3 months and it started making very weak coffee. I made several pots but no improvement. The color was not dark enough and it tasted very weak. I contacted Presto and the rep was very professional and courteous. She had me send her some pictures of the unit. She then called me and told me that I would have to send it back at their expense and they would have an engineer evaluate my issue. It was going to take AT LEAST 3 weeks and in the mean time we would not have a coffee pot. I didn't find that a satisfactory answer since we drink it every morning and have for the last 30 years so I elected to forego sending it in and just purchased another percolator from Elite Gourmet. They could have easily just sent me a replacement instead of making me wait. I think that was a poor decision on their part and I will never use another one of their products.,Michael Murphy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de marzo de 2023
Hot Coffee? Yes ... and a mouthful of grounds,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","First, I'll say that if you haven't had percolated coffee you need to give it a try. To me, it makes the best cup of coffee around. I've owned more than several Farberware percolators over the years. If you go through the reviews, you'll find that the Farberware percolator is notorious for eventually making cool coffee as it ages. I agree. All except one Farberware pot I have owned eventually lost its temperature control and it had to be replaced. On one the control went out immediately and would not percolate. I, like many other people who have reviewed the Farberware pot, was very unhappy about it. At the same time, it was the only pot that I could purchase locally, so when one failed I would replace it with another. So .. when the last Farberware went ""kaput"" I decided to do a little research and ended up purchasing the Presto 12-cup percolator based on the Amazon reviews. So far (after a few months use) it brews hot coffee and the coffee flavor is excellent. It brews quick. It is however much less substantial than the Faberware in terms of construction, and has a cheaper feel. However ... and this is a big however ... I can not make a pot of coffee without grounds floating all over the place! The last thing I need in a good cup of coffee is a mouthful of grounds. The basket lid fits poorly (terrible design compared to the Farberware) and to brew coffee without getting a lot of grounds is impossible. Had I to do it allover again, I'd go with Farberware with the understanding that it will need to be replaced in 3 to 5 years. It's too bad that here it is 2010 and no one makes a perfect, or near perfect, percolator.",Curt in Phoenix,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de abril de 2010
Horrible Coffee. No perking aroma. Won't stay warm for long.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I am a long-time Prime member and shop Amazon first before heading to the stores. I rarely write reviews, but I felt I needed to write one on this item. I was seeking a perculator to get away from a regular coffee maker. I was seeking the old-time sounds and smells, as well as great tasting coffee. I also wanted less plastic...didn't want my water soaking overnight in a plastic box. I have tried for a couple of weeks now to find the right amount of coffee to use. I just can't find the ""sweet spot"" so to speak. And it takes wayyyy more coffee to make 6 cups than my Cuisinart coffee maker. The coffee brews so very fast that I think it doesn't brew properly. There is barely the aroma of coffee brewing and there's no PERKING sound, more like a glopping noise. I could live with that, but at the end of the day I want a decent coffee taste and I don't want to have to microwave it to warm it up. The coffee tastes bitter. I have tried new coffees to see if that helps. Nothing works. You cannot unplug and leave for very long as it states you can. One more thing...you will need special WRAP FILTERS that I could not find in the stores, even Walmart. I'd have to buy on Amazon, which is an inconvenience when grocery shopping. Think twice about this one at least. At this point, I'm not even sure I'll try another brand of perculator.",S Guzman,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de agosto de 2020
Didn't last,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this coffee maker just over a year ago. Although the quality of the coffee it produced wasn't that great, it served its purpose when we had lots of visitors over. I liked that the machine didn't have plastic parts that came into contact with the coffee like a lot of other machines do.

Grounds Everywhere,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I think this has a bad design. I bought 2 units, both had same issue. if you make 4 cups or 10 cups the coffee grounds go everywhere and you must use a secondary filter.

Owning this is an adventure,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I never write reviews but I was just checking to see how long I've owned this and realized it's been less than a year. My recommendation to anyone buying this product -look for reviewers who have owned this for more than a year. Right out of the box, it was fantastic. Worked like a dream, great tasting coffee. Then, we started having problems with the grounds occasionally getting into the coffee - even though we didn't change a thing. OK, so I could deal with it. But then it became grounds almost every day - and then grounds every day - and then lots of grounds every day. It appears that when it's percolating, it gets one or 2 REALLY strong percs that blow the lid of the basket right off....then grounds everywhere in the coffee. OK, I could solve that problem easily enough. I bought the wrap-around percolator basket filters. Kinda bites because I always liked the ""ease of use"" of a percolator, never needed filters in other units, and the filters are a pain in the butt extra step. But OK fine, the coffee still tastes great and no more grounds. I can live with it. And now, 2 months after the ""coffee filter"" solution, it has sprung a leak. At the base of the spout. Seriously. Same deal...a little bit of coffee on the counter, then a little more, and then a whole cup. Solution: we put a bead of crazy glue along the outside seam of the spout. Seems to be holding up now, but as my husband says - we use a percolator so we aren't drinking coffee made in plastic parts. And now our coffee is made in parts being held together by chemicals! But...the coffee still tastes great. I can't wait for my next coffee-making adventure. By the way - I bought this in May, 2014.",JoJo,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de febrero de 2015
"A great machine for the price, but Canadian buyers beware.","2,0 de 5 estrellas","We were very pleased with this machine, as it heated up very quickly, produced excellent, hot coffee, and maintained it, hot, for as long as we needed it.

I just got off the phone with ""Cindy"" a very pleasant telephone support person , who informed me that the WARRANTY AS ADVERTISED, DOES NOT APPLY TO CANADA.

"It's all about the coffee, and this one was just not very good.","2,0 de 5 estrellas","Having been gifted a 1950s Pyrex Flameware percolator a few months ago, I embarked on a quest to introduce my family to the great taste of percolated coffee and banish the automatic drip from family gatherings. Unfortunately the 4-cup was just too small for that so based on the great reviews I purchased a 12-cup Presto. You can imagine my surprise when after washing it and brewing a test batch, I found an overwhelming metallic taste. More brews didn't solve the problem either. The metallic taste seemed to subside a little but it was still quite overpowering and remained as a strong aftertaste anyway. I ran the percolator with filtered water only and the aftertaste was still there clear as day.
Now, you'll probably think ""It's the water, stupid!"" but coffee brewed on the glass percolator or water straight out of the filter have absolutely no metal taste. It seems there's indeed something to the old Pyrex adage of ""You taste the coffee, not the pot"".
What I could taste from the coffee, it seemed to have a weaker, more watery moouthfeel that I'm used to from the Pyrex. I tried putting more grounds than I'd usually use on the cup and it did make it stronger,but when I opened it much of it had spilled out. I don't mind grounds in my coffee much, but it seemed kind of silly that it would spill them out with recommended amounts of coffee.

Body-wise, though the bottom plastic feels sort of cheap, the percolator seems solid. It goes through its cycles quickly and efficiently and stays on to keep your coffee hot. It's also very convenient in that it takes care of itself: you load it, plug it in and wait. Unfortunately, the coffee was subpar at best and nigh-on undrinkable at worst with the metal taste. I ended up returning mine.",Vivian C.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de febrero de 2014

Lasts only a couple of years,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Well I don't usually bother writing review, but thought I'd share this:
This percolator does make great coffee, as long as it works anyway. After owning it for only a little over a year, the cord where it attaches to the pot began making a sizzling sound. It didn't occur because water had seeped in around the terminals but rather that the connectors in the cord simply wasn't making good connection. I am always very careful not to allow water to get anywhere near the plug terminals. I have since replaced the cord at least a few more times- over a period of another 1 1/2 years due to the same problem thinking it was mostly a cheap cord connector issue. Recently, I noticed the terminals on the coffee pot itself was probably to blame, the entire time, due to the fact that those terminals were simply corroded and pretty much burned up, thereby preventing a good connection. I am now buying a new coffee pot instead of a $5 cord. Not to mention, the Presto 12 cupper I bought in 2015 is now over $60!
Hopefully, they have upgraded their electrical connectors for the extra cost.
I am sick of buying new cords for a 2 year old coffee pot. This time going for a different brand to hopefully last at least 3 years.",gavannb1,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de enero de 2018

Thin Metal,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Not good. Coffee pot metal is to thin. The coffee grind basket is shallow with tinny bottom hole which do not allow the coffee to drop correctly while using a filter. Also if put slightly to much ground coffee in the basket it comes out everywhere in the pot. Because the top is a press down snap in and not a insert twist to lock removing it while hot is difficult. The handle is thin very difficult to hold on too. The handle is also a funny shape and to big large. The coffee pot spout wants to shoot the coffee out straight when tilting toward your cup because the handle, the pot, and the actual coffee do not allow for proper balancing when pouring. 10 thumbs down.",Ed Kaplin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de abril de 2022

Disappointed with coffee quality,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this pot in April 2018 to replace a 10 cup pot with a broken top and weak coffee. I had hoped that the Presto, with mostly positive feedback, would improve the quality and strength of the perk. The strength started strong and has decreased even more. My first perk took 12 minutes from plug in to light on. The perk time has slowly decreased until it is now 4 minutes. I've tried all I could to improve the quality and strength, including changing to a dark roast, changing the grind, reducing the water, increasing the coffee in the basket and cleaning the pot. I even tried another perk with previously perked coffee...nothing seems to work. It's ready for the trash. I'm seriously considering a perk on the stove with memory of a glass coffee pot that created great coffee or a French Press. It's time for a bit of investigation starting with a roastery married to the proper coffee maker. It is obvious that I need a percolator that allows me the ability to control the perk time for a longer perk either by dial or time on the stove. Allowing the percolator to automatically control the perk time and temperature is not working for me.",Photon713,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de junio de 2018
very disappointed in the product,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","the coffee pot stopped working today after 8 months. I do not consider $38 ""throw away"". very disappointed in the product.

an update.... the company replaced the coffee maker. what they found was the electrical part was rusted. I was told do not immerse the pot in water. who does that? I explained to them that I never have, never was the outside, BUT it is inevitable that some water will get on the outside of the pot from rinsing the inside and just from hands while holding it. I believe in is a flaw in design. the replacement one is doing the same thing... it you shake it, a bit of water will come out of the black area where the electric parts are. I have an electric coffee pot years ago that never had this problem... then again I have just had a coffee travel mug, brand new, that leaked. unfortunately, everything seems to be made now as if it is throwaway after a few months.

"Inferior to Faberware... I returned it within a week.,","2,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this after going to my aunts and tasting her peculator coffee (not sure the maker). I was disappointed because the coffee tasted watery. It was less flavorful than my drip coffee maker. I tried two coffee brands just to make sure it wasn't a bad coffee. I tried one drip grade grind and the other perc grad grind. I didn't notice a difference in taste both were watery. I tried both with and without the filters, no difference. I tried to follow the instuctions and even watched a Youtube video to ensure I was prepping the coffee correctly.

I used it everyday for a week... all watery. I returned it for the Faberware and there is a world of difference. The tube sits nicely in the whole on the Faberwae unit whereas in the Presto it wobbled and perhaps got misaligned(?). I'm not sure if that matter. There is a possibility that I bought a lemon. But the Faberware coffee tastes 100% better. There was not second guessing on if I was using it correctly based on its superior taste.

There are aspects of the presto that I like such as the sturdy handle and top. The coffee was piping hot. The chord is longer than Faberware's cord and Presto has a small orange light that goes off when the coffee is ready. But these niceties are not enough to make me suffer through gross, sub par coffee.",Lindsey,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de agosto de 2014
Brews Such Weak Coffee,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought this based on the ""star rating"" left by other consumers and after reading a handful of reviews - that was my mistake. I should have searched reviews for ""strength of coffee"" or ""weak coffee"" since strength of coffee is important to me. This percolator brews the weakest coffee I've ever made. I had to fill the basket to the brim, add a another filter hoping that it would help the hot water sit in the grounds a little longer, and add less water to make the coffee stronger. I would go broke on coffee if I continued to use this percolator. I packed it up and went back to my drip coffee maker after about 2 weeks of trying to make a decently strong cup of coffee. I intended to return it but forgot about it and missed the return window time frame. So now I feel I need to make it work and am going to try a finer grind of beans.

Weak coffee,"2,0 de 5 estrellas",I’ve had this percolator for 6 weeks and I’m replacing it with another brand. It could handle about 4 cups at a time but trying to make any more than that isn’t happening. Coffee comes out weak and zero flavor.

Don’t make the same mistake.,Kellee Cameron,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de noviembre de 2022
"Not reliable, disappointing product","2,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this percolator based on the enthusiastic reviews at this website and others. I will say this: when it works, it makes a great cup of coffee that is hot (better than drip makers) and tasty. The problem is the temperamental perc tube. The book advises that if the tube is not ""perfectly"" placed in the well, the unit will not start perc'ing. We had no problems the first month of daily use, but then we noted we'd have to reposition the stand-up perc tube a few times (no real rhyme or reason to the technique) to get it going. Finally it just wouldn't work (at just 2 mos after purchase.) We cleaned it, scrubbed it, etc, no use. We contacted Presto and they told us to mail it to a repair center, which we did. It came back with a note, ""cleaned it inside and out, works great."" We got 2 pots of coffee out of it before it started up the same way. Some mornings no problem, other mornings takes 4-5 tries. Believe me, we've standardized our technique, but no use!

While this pot was at the repair place, I bought a Farberware 12-cup percolator. The coffee it brews is not quite as hot, but it's close, and it works every time. I note the Farberware pot has a tube well that's all one piece of metal (no seam), so that could be the difference.

I say, just go with the Farberware model PK1200ss! Got it for $69.99 at Bed Bath & Beyond, also same price at Macy's.",Amateur reviewer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de enero de 2013
After 2 Brews Coffee Tasted Like Water,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I’m sure for a person who’s not selective about the strength and richness of their brew, this will work just fine. The first couple brews were okay, but after that it consistently brewed the coffee to taste like water. Completely dark brew, but also completely lacking in an coffee flavor whatsoever. Really disappointing. This is my 3rd attempt at a pot that doesn’t cost more than $100.00. Next, I’ll be trying a French press.",Angela,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de mayo de 2023
"It’s touch and go. Right now, it’s go...","2,0 de 5 estrellas","The Presto percolator worked great for the first six months. I knew the secret, or so I thought. Coarser grounds (percolator grind.) Additional paper filter. (I hate that this is needed.) Make sure the stem for the filter basket is seated properly. Hold steady and put that lid on ASAP. Keep it clean.

Around six months in, I started noticing filter “explosions.” The lid kept blowing off. All of the time. It didn’t matter what I tried. I called Presto, and they told me it needed deep cleaning with powdered dish detergent. It didn’t help. I called back. I emailed. I guess I was hoping someone could help. My option was paying for shipping to send it for diagnostics.

Don’t get me wrong. I love the taste and temp of the coffee. I am seriously bummed. My parents used a percolator, and I know they had a few grounds in the bottom of their cups. A few. But not crunchy coffee. I don’t think I should have to use a cheesecloth, so I see a pod-type coffee maker in my future. Sigh.

VERY Inconsistent Machine,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I have been using this perk for two months now, and it is the most inconsistent coffee maker I've ever had. In those two months, I have never had the same pot of coffee twice. I always use the same measure of coffee (I grind my beans right before I make coffee) and the same amount of filtered water. But one time it will be so weak as to be just hot water really, then the next day, it will be very very strong. I've tried everything I can to get this machine to percolate good coffee. I always make sure the perc tube is properly seated in the bottom hole, I twist it slightly to make sure is centered. And still I get bad pots all the time.

The only thing I do like about this machine is the overall looks of it, and its speed. It makes the pots at 1 cup per minute. So for an 8 cup pot, it takes 8 minutes.

I cannot recommend this one to anyone and have gone back now to my old Corningware Stove Top percolator.",C. Foster,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de octubre de 2017
buyer beware,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","this item was fine for the first 2 weeks. we cleaned it daily, never submersed it in water and followed all of the guidelines. previously, we used a ceramic coffee pot and wanted something that held more coffee and kept it warm. And it was great for 2 weeks. We were so confident that we threw out the box. It just stopped working. We tried to make coffee and as soon as the coffee pot was plugged in, the light came on as if the coffee was already made. we tried troubleshooting with no avail. Thankfully and after an hour chat, we were able to return it without a box. the process to return this item was a headache and after chatting for an hour, i no longer wanted a replacement. I was also transferred 3x and reiterated when it worked it was fine and served its purpose. learn from our mistake don't throw out the box and hope you don't get a faulty pot.",JTL,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de enero de 2020
Awkward compared to traditional drip coffee makers with similar results,"2,0 de 5 estrellas",I purchased this thinking it would make a better cup of coffee than a typical drip coffee maker would. Sadly it does not. Putting the paper filter in is a bit of a chore and keeping the unit clean when the base should not be submerged is laborious. Product is also large and ugly for the counter-top. My recommendation would be to pass on this item.,Kristine Boteilho,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de mayo de 2023
Grounds in my coffee,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I love the idea of a perculator and the coffee does taste great however EVERY time I made coffee, no matter what tricks I tried with the filter, I always got at least a TBSP of coffee grounds once the cycle was done brewing.

Presto doesn’t seem to worry to much about their customers health that want to avoid aluminum. It’s a cool looking coffee maker, but it’s defiantly got issues.

inconsistent flavor and coffee grounds boil out of the top of the basket and into your coffee,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I have been using different brand percolators for the past 25 years and I just don't understand why the presto doesn't give me the same full flavor as all the others. I got so tired of all the other brands only lasting a few months so I tried the presto. True it does last about 2+ years which is better than the others and cost a little less but I'm really missing that wonderful smell and taste. This is my 3rd one and still the same thing. Guess I may need to just get over the price and longiviity and buy the other brand next time. SO disappointed and don't understand why all the great reviews. Maybe they never tried the other brand of percolators? Also be prepared for a huge mess with the coffee grounds boiling out of the top of the basket, and yes, I wet my basket before putting in the coffee grounds. Not worth it. I'm going back to the other percolators.",BT,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de noviembre de 2019
Not Happy,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought this pot in December. It looked great and had some nice reviews.
HOWEVER, after using this coffee maker 5x week, the insides ( which are NOT stainless steel) have corroded and the color of the parts are rusty brown. True stainless steel would not react like this and they would wash beautifully. The inner parts look like this pot seem poorly made, of some corrodible cheap material. I NEVER let coffee sit. Clean up right away. Very dissatisfied!
In my opinion, would NOT suggest wasting your $$$ on this pot. Presto used to make great products.",Sandy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de marzo de 2022
Makes weak coffee that's full of grounds,"2,0 de 5 estrellas",The holes in the bottom of the basket are so small that they are blocked by the grounds. The water backs up and the basket overflows sending ground coffee into the pot. The bottom of the pot ends up with a layer of grounds in the bottom that pour out with the coffee.

Metallic taste,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I cleaned the pot and its parts before the first use. I use 8 level tbsp of LaVazza for 8 cups.

I really want this to work.",Sierra Man,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de marzo de 2023
Beware mold,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","The coffee is okay. For the price and the fact that there is no plastic that touches the hot coffee, it's good enough.

I really cannot recommend this if you like coffee, and don't want to constantly worry about mold.",Sonny williams,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de diciembre de 2022
"Great Coffee, Short Lifespan","2,0 de 5 estrellas","While it lasted, this was a great percolator. It brewed quickly, and made a consistently good cup of coffee. Like many percolators, if I used ground coffee, it tended to end up with a few grounds in the cup. One solution is to use whole beans and ground it more coarsely.

I opted for taking paper coffee filters, tearing them in half, poking a hole in the middle, and using them at the bottom of the coffee canister.

This percolator worked fine, but I think it stopped working prematurely. I bought it just over two years ago, used it less than once a week, and suddenly this week it started perc'ing clear water, and the coffee in the pot stayed dry. I cleaned it, ran it a couple of more times, even in smaller amounts. It brewed coffee a couple of times, but has a lot of grounds in it.

So, 5 for taste, 1 for durability.",B. Colonna,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de agosto de 2017
Excessive grounds,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","We're still looking for a decent coffee percolator. This is the third brand we've tried in as many years.

The Farberware's cord is too heavy, the pins are too small, and the connection burned out in about a year.
The Hamilton Beach stopped making coffee hot enough after about a year--apparently the thermostat failed.

We sent this one (the Presto 12 cup) back after about 6 weeks and several attempts to make a good pot of hot reasonably clear coffee. There are always excessive grounds in the coffee. We've never had to use a filter in a percolator, so we tried this without one. When the coffee had too much sediment, we tried a paper filter. Coffee grounds spilled over the top of the very light metal basket and into the coffee. We bought the ""three year"" filter sold on Amazon. The filter is so small that it can be used for no more than six cups of coffee at the strength we like. There was some improvement with the filter, but the coffee was still murky. One other reviewer apparently had a basket from another manufacturer that fit the Presto and solved the problem. That might work, but the Farberware basket doesn't fit and it's the only other one we had.

Right now we're using the Cuisinart programmable drip coffee maker. It's OK, but we prefer perked coffee.

Amazon refunded the full price including shipping immediately on receipt of the return. Thanks!",Mtkaat,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de enero de 2011
If you like chunky coffee- this is for you,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Chunky Coffee- you know, coffee full of grounds. The filter basket clogs up, the basket fills up with water and since the basket lid isn't held down firmly, the grounds float up and out into your coffee. The pouring spout opening is near the bottom, where the grounds settle. I've tried using the paper filters, but the basket drain holes are so small that the water can't pass through fast enough to prevent the grounds floating up and out of the basket.

Going retro (UPDATED),"2,0 de 5 estrellas","We started with a high-priced Cuisinart drip coffee maker with all the bells and whistles. That died, just like the others. We went to a French press a couple months ago simply because it was quick, cheap and easy to clean. The coffee was good, but I didn't like having to use coarse-ground coffee. I also didn't like that it only made two mugs at a time. So we went retro and got this percolator. I just used it for the first time and the coffee is probably the best I've ever had in my adult life. I like its simplicity, and I obviously like the price.

*****UPDATE: After a few pots of coffee from this we noticed a metallic taste. I read that others had noticed this as well. It will not go away. Disregard everything I said above.

However, after having two cups of hot coffee, the third or fourth cup needs reheating in the microwave. After a thorough cleaning (recommended by a company rep), it performed somewhat better, but then reverted to the point where the 2nd and 3rd cup were lukewarm at best. After a second email conversation with the company rep, she noted that one of the screws on the bottom of the pot was somewhat rusted and said that I must have gotten water on the bottom of the pot which brought about the poor performance. When I asked if a replacement thermostat was available, the reply was that Presto does not sell that part --which means it is unrepairable!",Saaremaa,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de noviembre de 2020

Surprised This Is Rated So High,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I love percolator coffee, but I would not recommend this Presto percolator. Over a short period of time (a couple of weeks of daily use), the taste of the coffee goes downhill. It gets a metallic quality. The other reviews regarding the aluminum heating element are true. I don't make if that is the exact cause of the bad, metallic taste, but it's at least an indication of the cheap quality of this percolator that leads to the bad taste. I returned this percolator and ended up getting the Faberware model -- still 12 cups -- and I'm much happier.

Love this coffee maker but...,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Updating my review and reducing from 4 stars to two. I am on my 3rd Presto coffee maker. Looking up my orders on Amazon reveals these coffee makers have an approximate 2 year life. That is too short and reveals poor design/quality. It is the same problem each time. The Two Prongs inside the coffee maker that attach to the cord corrodes over time making a poor electrical connection. Sometimes it causes overheating of the cord at the corroded prong end. Makes an electrical fire smell. Also, this corrosion effects the amount of heat the coffee maker produces.

So... I guess I am now in search of a better quality maker.

This coffee maker is a bit slow to perk, gets and keeps the coffee hot, is easy to clean, has legacy styling (like the Farberware my Mom had for over 50 years), does allow some grinds thru (we used Melitta filters) but, makes weak coffee regardless of filter use or not, or grind. This is compared to the Hamilton Beach and to our already heavy hand with the coffee measure. We used this twice daily over 2 weeks, making 10 cups each time.
Bottom line. Consistently weaker coffee than what we desire. Will return for refund.",Kid Doc,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de enero de 2017

It would start brewing very weak coffee after a period of time which would require an intensive cleaning of the small holes, only to start brewing very weak coffee soon thereafter, and it was difficult to tell what the problem was. To use the warranty, you have to send it in at your own expense and I was told they would send it back if they found nothing, or replace it if it couldn't be fixed, but absolutely no refunds.

whats that noise,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","i baught the presto 12 c and thought i was getting a quality product. when i made my first pot during the brewing process i was hearing a loud rapping/clanking sound that was not the normal soft gergaling noises that you would expect from a perc coffee maker. this noise was intermittent not constant but was distracting none the less. i emailed presto and described the problem and they replyed that i didnt have the stem seated properly. well you can only seat the stem so far and thats it. i sent the product back to presto and they sent me a new unit with the same result. you might say i'm making much ado about nothing but this clanking noise was very distracting to me and i have to say it is a design flaw that was excceptable to presto. if you dont mind a noisy clanking coffee maker that makes decent coffee than the presto 12 c perculator is for you but not for me

Limited lifespan for coffeepot,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I have now purchased 6 or 7 of these coffeepots. They work great for about 6 months then they seem to lose their brain. The coffee in the pot cools and then the pot starts perking again. It will repeat this cycle (unless you hear the noise) until you have a cup of sludge. Don't know if this is electrical failure, or temperature sensor but either way needs replacement. The most important reason I purchase so many of these pots (other than hoping I just got a 'lemon') is that it doesn't have auto-shutoff. We do drink coffee longer than the 2 hours many pots allow. Now I have found another brand without auto shutoff, so here's hoping it works longer than 4-6 months.",Ginny,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de noviembre de 2015

The bottom is rusting out :( Do NOT recommend.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Overall, this makes good coffee. I like that I'm not having to use paper filters, and it's relatively easy to clean, altho not as easy to clean and make a new pot in some respects compared to electric drip coffeemaker. What I do NOT like is that the bottom (inside) of this coffee pot started showing rusty spots within the first few weeks, and now in less than 3 months of making a pot a day, I strongly suspect that it is simply going to rust all the way through the bottom in the very near future. NOT happy with that, especially considering that we paid double to triple what an electric drip coffee maker would have cost. I wasn't happy having to replace inexpensive drip coffee makers every year--I don't think this one is even going to make it to 6 months.

"Good, some problems, but great customer sevrice","3,0 de 5 estrellas","PLEASE SEE LAST UPDATE TWO.

We are on our 3rd one (update : 4th), and always have the same problem with the Presto. After about a year, the plug element becomes a problem and starts to overheat the plug and cord or 'keep wart,' element fails. Buying a replacement cord ($6) will give you maybe another 4 months of use. But none of these have made it to the 2 year mark (unlike my moms which seemed to last forever). Eventually that plug area will fail.

It also can be slow but as advertised - 1 cup per minute. 12 cups will indeed take about 12 minutes to finish starting with cold tap water. 12 minutes can be agonizing in the morning and sometimes even after feeding and letting the dog out and getting the newspaper I am still waiting for it to finish. (Yes, some of us still use a percolator AND read a newspaper!)

I grant you we use it a LOT. We make about 3-6 pots of coffee a day depending on who is around and day of the week. Yet, despite the heavy use, we do take care of it. We are careful with washing, making sure the electrical element never gets wet. We descale it regularly. Yet, it is always the same problem. Trouble is, there is not much competition. If you want an all stainless steel assembly electric percolator at a reasonable price, there is not much out there.

We considered something like the Bunn, but who needs a coffee maker plugged in all the time to keep the reservoir hot? We also considered a stove top model, but in true chicken or egg fashion, it seems too labor intensive before drinking first cup of coffee. Most drip makers have too much plastic and/or burn the coffee too quickly if left on the hot plate. So not much choice.

So if you are a casual drinker, you might get a longer life. If you are heavier coffee drinkers, you may only get a year+ out of this Presto. Sadly, we have just resigned ourselves to the fact that coffee makers have to be purchased every year-and-a-half or so. Why does 1-1/2 years seem to go by more quickly than those first 12 minutes in the morning waiting for a cup of joe? ;-)

UPDATE: Contacted by Presto customer service who replaced the pot free of charge. Customer service was VERY responsive and accommodating. They didn't say so, but the new pot has a different (better) feel to the plug-in component. It feels tighter yet smoother. They suggested for heavy coffee drinkers to keep plug attached for quick rinses; obviously not getting electric components wet. We had done both of these things with previous units. I have high hopes for the new unit and as mentioned, Presto customer service is first rate.

UPDATE 2: A little over 2 years and the same issue with this product. This time the heating element just stopped working. It will brew, light will remain lit, but coffee does not stay hot/warm. In fact, if you leave it plugged in, it will begin brewing cycle again when pot gets cooler. This seems to have a built in, limited life cycle. In about 11 years we have gone through 4 of the Prestos, an average of about 2-1/2 years.
Hopefully another brand gives us a similarly good brew but is designed to last a little longer.",Caprican,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de marzo de 2015
Depends on your goal,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This meets my goal of plastic-free coffee but if that's not your goal, I'd probably pass. Even with a filter, grounds and sediment end up in the coffee and the overall experience of prep, brewing and clean up is just okay.",Brian,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de marzo de 2024
It's okay.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I was way more excited about this percolator when we first purchased it from Amazon, than I am now after using it for several months. I love percolated coffee when I visit my relatives and since our drip maker died on us, I decided to make the switch. We purchased this after reading all the great reviews.

So, I've been using it for several months now.

Pros:
1. it does make good coffee most of the time. Use level scoops not heaping. I actually use a smaller scoop than a standard Mr. Coffee scoop and the smaller one works much better, unless you like really strong coffee. If you don't, use smaller scoops. For 8 cups of coffee we use 7.5 scoops.
2. It brews much hotter coffee. I use milk in my coffee and normally heat the milk first but with this it isn't necessary as the coffee is very hot and mixes well with non-heated milk.

Cons:
1. This may say 12-cup coffee maker but it really isn't. I couldn't make 10 cups without all the grounds spilling out into the coffee. The basket and coffee maker just aren't large enough for 12 cups. 8 is the most I'll try after disaster with 10. I could always make the specified amount of coffee in my drip maker.
2. Yes, you will get a mouth full of grounds without a filter used in the basket. Nearly every time. Maybe not on the first cup but by the time you get to the bottom of the pot you'll need a strainer for the coffee. I don't like grounds in my mouth and this never happened with my drip maker.
3. Filters for this are very expensive compared to drip makers, and honestly I don't want to have to specially grind my coffee before preparing it, to make the grounds large enough not to fall through the basket. I've been cutting holes in my standard Mr. Coffee filters to use with this but as they don't cover the top as the more expensive made-for-percolating filters do, coffee still spills over and into the coffee, even with smaller 6-cup pots. I was going to purchase the special reusable filter for this but it doesn't have very good reviews and since it doesn't have a top the same thing will happen: Coffee grounds will still spill over the top and into the coffee.
4. I don't like to stand around slowly scooping coffee into a basket with a hole in the middle but this is what I now do. Put my finger over the hole and scoop coffee into the basket with the other. I hadn't really thought about that before I got this but honestly, I enjoyed not having to be so precise before. If I miss just a little bit, coffee might spill onto the counter either through the middle hole or over the cylindrical side. Actually, if I don't use a paper filter, I find coffee on the counter just from scooping it into the basket because it falls through the basket holes. No, I don't put the basket in the coffee maker first because if anything spills there, it will go into the water.
5. No shut off timer. So your coffee has a higher chance of burning if you don't remember to turn it off.

So all in all I gave it 3 stars. Sometimes though it feels like 2. I make coffee less often now because I find this percolator to be a bother to work with.",Surf,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de octubre de 2013
Contains aluminum,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This percolator is well made and makes a very good cup of coffee. The flavor is excellent. However, for those who are concerned about aluminum coming into contact with brewing coffee, this percolator contains aluminum. Although the exterior and most components are stainless steel. The percolator well and nut at the bottom of the inside are made of aluminum. This was confirmed by an email from Presto customer service.

Not impressed,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","We recently switched from a plastic drip coffee maker to using a stainless steel stove top percolator. It makes wonderful tasting coffee, but it takes almost 30 minutes to brew from start to finish. We wanted to try something that brewed coffee faster and in a larger amount, hence the purchase of this unit.

I was very surprised and dismayed, upon first use, to discover that the percolator sounds like a washing machine. It was so unpleasantly loud that I had to leave the kitchen. Actually, I had to go upstairs to get away from the horrible noise. The delicious smell of percolating coffee was absent.

I brewed 12 cups (which is 60oz) with 14TBS coffee. The coffee looked dark enough upon pouring. There were coffee grounds in the brew, but that isn’t a problem to me. I proceeded to blend our coffee as usual (we make a butter-coffee blend). I was not impressed with the flavor. It was weak and bitter (and I did use the same ratio of water to coffee as we use in our stove top percolator). That lovely caramel coffee flavor was absent. After finishing my first cup, I did not find myself very motivated to pour the second.

If the coffee doesn’t taste good, what’s the point of drinking it (aside from the caffeine hit)?

Noisy brewing. Less flavor. No coffee aroma. To me, it’s not worth the speed in brewing. I’ll stick with our old-school stove top percolator.",Antulien37,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de enero de 2023

Not a good purchase -would ot recommend this!,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought this coffee pot a month ago and at first it was working great. Coffee tasted good and was very hot. Then after two weeks we started getting grounds in our coffee. Presto customer service suggested we use the enclosed coffee filters (in all the 20 years we have used electric percolators never did we have to use a “filter” in the basket).
Well then our coffee was very weak and you could see that it didn’t percolate all the way through the grounds. We removed the filter and decided to just strain the coffee before drinking it. Then this week the pot would percolate but the coffee was weak. Presto customer service said we were putting the stem in wrong (?!) so again we tried it and placed it in as we always do and this time the coffee was good. The next morning another pot was made and it was weak. We just want to wake up in the morning and make our coffee without any issues and that is why we returned it for a refund.",Kathi Rahal,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de mayo de 2023

Now, the coffee boils and boils, and the ready-to-serve light never comes on. Unless you unplug it at some point to stop it from perking, the coffee just boils away. On the plus side, when it worked, the coffee tasted great. It's somewhat of an expensive percolator to last not even a year, and for this reason, I don't recommend it.",J.

Still in the testing phase,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","My rationale for getting this admittedly old fashioned kitchen staple was through the process of elimination. Our water is very hard and I go through coffee pots regularly despite frequent cleanings. Each pot leading up to this one was cheaper than the one before it (read that ""Cuisinart to Mr. Coffee""). Whether expensive or inexpensive, none, in my opinion, stood out as exemplary. I took to the Internet to research various pots and reviews were mixed. So I decided to go ""retro.""

While the Presto does not have the glass top I remember from my childhood (when one could watch the actual perking for those of you too young to remember), its parts are familiar and easy to keep clean. I've played with and adapted the paper filters -- it's awkward at best to fashion the paper packet in which the coffee sits in order to avoid having grounds in your cup. I also suspect that the overabundance of paper has something to do with the fact that I was using double the amount of coffee and still struggling to get a properly strong brew. I tried no filter at all (grounds in cup) and settled on cutting the filter into a disk to fit the bottom of the basket. Adequate fix.

I'm still messing about with the ratio of coffee to water. I use a regular grind (Costco's Kirkland brand) and for 6 cups of water I use 5 large scoops. I guess I've settled on approximately one less scoop per cup of water. (Note: For the sake of comparison, I purchased some high-end coffee ground specifically for percolators and didn't perceive much of a difference.)

The pros of this pot are the coffee is HOT and clear. The only con is convenience, in this age of K cups and other pod-style appliances. It takes a few minutes to make a pot: there are more parts to clean and preparation requires a few steps. The coffee brews quickly, but still, those of you who are hooked on instant gratification might want to pass.

Will I ditch all other pots for this one? Probably not. I'll always be looking. But for now I'm satisfied with my blast-from-the-past percolator.",TejasPenguin,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de febrero de 2014
It is REALLY loud,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this as it had good reviews and wanted something that mad HOT coffee that a regular drip machine just cant do. The percolator is a nice retro style which I like. I put this on a timer outlet so that it would make coffee by the time I get up for work and what I discovered is this thing is so loud that it woke me up thinking someone was slamming their fist on the kitchen counter top ever 30 or so seconds. I dont ever remember any percolator we ever had being that loud. Secondly, all the reviews raved about how much better the coffee was. I use Starbucks Italian roast that comes pre ground in fine grind and was weak and tasteless. I did use the included filters which seem to be more of a pain than they are worth so tomorrow I am going to try and make it without a filter to see if it makes a difference like others state though I did just order 4 boxes of the filters from Melitta directly for per box since Amazon is charging 10X that.

"Nice Perc, if you want to make 8 cups, not 12","3,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been using stove top or ""camping"" percolators for a very long time, and they work great, but notoriously take longer than an electric one. So, I'm trying to find an electric percolator that works as well, where all parts are stainless steel and/or glass, that has clear cup markings, and will keep the coffee hot after finishing the brew. So, this one does all that. However, if you try to make more than 8 cups, you get coffee grinds in your coffee and even in the well under the water shaft. So, even though it says 12 cups capacity, it really is not. And, unlike a stove top perc, you can't control the heat (i.e. lowering the flame to reduce the frequency of the boiled water up ""shots"", so that the water doesn't come up the shaft as fast, giving it time to seep through the basket without overflow). So, yeah, if you're ok with an 8 cup max (40 oz of coffee total) it works great. But, since this is not the capacity advertised, I'm giving it 3 stars.",BostonFashionable,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de mayo de 2022

The coffee grounds will be perfectly dry. So I empty the water out, and put back in the cold refrigerator water just like before and it will perk.
And of course, it didn't start this till after the 30 day point so there was no returning it!

Cord firer after one month,"3,0 de 5 estrellas",I have to save I loved the coffee this pot made. Only gave it 3 stars for the following reason. Made coffee this morning and was very good. My husband accidently pulled the cord out of the pot before pulling from socket. Now this was stated in the directions not to do. But who knew actual flames shot out of the end like a torch. The cord was ruined and the plug into the pot is black. I went to the Amazon website to report and find out if I could get a replacement cord. I was directed to the Casa.com company. I contacted there service rep. I explained what happened. She was concerned about my well being and stated that something like this should never have happened. She was ready to replace the pot but unfortunately it was out of stock. She gave me the phone number for contacting Presto. I called and explained what happened. I was told since the cord was unplugged from the pot they would not replace it. I stated that flames shot out like a torch. Again was told since it was unplugged from pot they would do nothing. Called the Casa.com company back and explained to a different rep the situation. He did not believe something like that could happen and the Presto co. did not back up their product. He then said they would refund my costs. Truly a great company to do business with. I will research another manufacturer for a replacement. Should you own one of these coffee pots use caution with the cord. I wonder that the pot is accidently unplugged from pot while pouring coffee since keeping the pot plugged in keeps the coffee hot. Oh checked with a licensed electrician and was told this should never happen.

"Good looking, great tasting, but lacks critical safety features.","3,0 de 5 estrellas","I'll start by saying this coffee maker looks great and it's well made. It makes great tasting coffee. It is a bit slow (one cup a minute takes a while when you're brewing 12 cups). It comes with several large square coffee filters that cover the bottom of the grounds container and fold over the top of the grounds like an envelope. I purchased some 3.5 inch round filters from BrewRite that just sit on the bottom of the grounds container and they work just as well. I've used the coffee maker about six times and haven't found a single coffee ground in my cup yet.

One advantage to this design is that you can clean all the parts easily - there are no hidden tubes or valves or whatnot. It's important to clean the inside each time you use it - just a quick swipe with a damp paper towel is all it takes. I also recommend using filtered water - I have a Pur jug - to avoid calcium deposits. Another reviewer recommended using a spout brush to occasionally clean the inside of the spout and the holes in the grounds container. This is a good idea too. Keeping this unit clean is easy and worth the effort.

However there are three things it absolutely needs to get a five star review.

1. Add an on-off switch. Having to unplug it to turn it off is not cool.
2. There's no way to see how much coffee is still inside.
3. Needs to turn off automatically when drained or after four hours. I'm really worried I will forget to unplug it one Friday evening and come in to work on Monday to find it destroyed or even worse.",Math Addict,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de diciembre de 2014
THE INTERIOR OF THE POT CONTAINS ALUMINUM PER PRESTO CUSTOMER SERVICE,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this percolator to get away from consuming BPA from my drip coffee maker. I researched and found that stainless steel was a healthy choice. I chose this pot based on the description stating that it is stainless steel. In reality, the pot contains aluminum in the interior base under the perk tube. I noticed that the coffee was staining the bottom of the pot and it looked like it was rusting. When I called customer service, they confirmed that it is aluminum in that area. I want to drink aluminum less than I want to drink plastics, so I am returning this percolator.

If the metal doesn't concern you, this is a decent pot. The pot itself is fairly substantial and seems well-built. The basket and perk tube are a thinner quality metal than the old Farberware percolator that I had in the 80s. Obviously, little is made with that quality build anymore. The coffee is piping hot and I mean HOT! If you have an elderly person or child around, that might be a concern. It could potentially cause third degree burns if it were overturned on anyone. I personally like very hot coffee, but even I could not drink it straight from the pot. It had to cool a bit.

I bought a package of Brew Rite disc percolator coffee filters at the local grocery store and there was little grounds in the bottom of the pot. I didn't feel the coffee tasted as bitter as it does in the drip-style coffee pot. What a disappointment to find out that the interior of this pot has aluminum in it.",Kimberly,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de julio de 2015
excellent coffeemaker,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","My parents had one of these when I was a kid in the 70's and early 80's, but back then it had a glass handle on top of the lid which was neat cuz you could see the coffee bubbling up inside it but the problem was it was easy to break and would need replacing a couple of times a year. The hard plastic handle on top is a marked improvement. On the downside, the grounds reservoir was also flatter and wider back then. A bit more care now needs to be taken when adding the ground coffee into it, so as not to make a mess on the counter. This isn't enough to prevent me from giving this coffeemaker a 5-star rating though, because the coffee it makes is terrific. It is also HOT! very hot. This was one of my reasons for buying it because I was tired of tepid coffee from my drip coffeemaker. Problem solved! I don't see the need to use a filter of any kind in it, it tastes fabulous without using one, with only a very small amount of grounds in the last sip of the cup, and sometimes not even then. This is good because the wraparound filters are a good bit more expensive than basket filters for drip coffeemakers. I did try punching a hole in the bottom of a basket filter and using that but there were two problems with that. First, I still got that same small amount of grounds in my cup of coffee so it wasn't doing much there. Second, even more care was required when adding coffee grounds to the reservoir because there really isn't very much room there. IMO a basket filter in this coffeemaker is completely worthless and unnecessary.

"Makes ""blah"" coffee","3,0 de 5 estrellas","After reading the reviews on this coffee maker, as well as on several other machines, I decided to give this a try. I was also fed up with having to deal with k-cups and the Keurig machine doing whatever it wanted to do instead of behaving properly,

The first go-around, the coffee tasted very weak, there were grinds at the bottom, and there was a general odor of burnt coffee (I did water level 2, 2.5 scoops of beans (ground to medium coarseness)). My second try (day two) consisted of a slightly better-tasting coffee, but still semi-weak, with slight coffee grinds at the bottom, along with the clinging smell of burnt coffee (I did water level 4, 6 scoops of beans (ground to medium coarseness, pulsed with my coffee bean grinder versus continuous)). My third and final try (day three) consisted of using a coffee filter (the Melitta disc ones specified for all percolators) to prevent grinds at the bottom of my coffee, and viola....no grinds, and better-tasting/stronger coffee; the burnt smell still lingered, though, and it was honestly a gross smell to associate with coffee currently being consumed. Blegh.

Needless to say, I am returning this coffee maker. It makes okay coffee, but I am not going to settle for ""just okay."" Additionally, I hate having to use disposable coffee filters. I am somewhat of a coffee snob (I refuse to use already-ground coffee, and prefer fresh, home-made espresso any day over a cup of java), so I know that there is a better machine out there...I just haven't found it yet.

Difficult to get a strong cup of coffee,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","It takes too much to make sure you get the right cup of coffee. The water has to be ice cold so it doesn't stop percolating too early, the percolator tube has to be seated just right on the bottom of the pot, the coffee has to be a fine grind in the bucket, no filter or top cover to the coffee bucket can be used, and the water tank can't be filled more than a little past halfway if you want a decent chance at a dark cup of coffee. Note that with the above, you will get grinds in the coffee, but otherwise I just get a cup of dirty coffee water. Still looking for things to do to make it better / get a strong cup without so much thought and strategy.",Haley,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de marzo de 2022
Great coffee but does not last long,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I love the coffee this coffeemaker makes. However, I have gone through many of these percolators. At first I thought it was our hard water, so we purchased a nice water softener for our home. Not the issue. These coffeemakers make delicious coffee. We don't use a filter in the pot. We love good coffee and generally make two pots of coffee a day every day. The pot generally gives out after about 6 months. We clean it and take good care of it, but they just never last long for us. We always keep a spare one for when they die on us. For us, good coffee is just worth the fuss. I just wish they would make them good enough to last a few years so we wouldn't have to keep buying new coffeepots every few months.","Retired RN, artist and gardener",Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de octubre de 2021

Don't be fooled. Not very good.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","It takes way too much coffee grinds, and makes the coffee way to weak. I followed the instructions religiously and have tried everything - still very weak compared to a drip coffee maker. I used ice cold water as per instructions and filled with coffee grinds to the cover - still weak. It percolates the water too fast, that is the problem. A good percolator will percolate slowly so the hot water drips over the coffee. This runs over the coffee.

Disappointing Flavor,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I really wanted to like this product. I read dozens of reviews for this model/brand before I decided to purchase from Amazon. It made it onto several top 10 lists so I decided to go for it. I have had the coffee maker for about 2 months and have not had a good tasting cup of coffee yet. The flavor tastes burnt. My husband and I have both tried making coffee in this percolator hoping that one of us will ""get it right"". We both fail and the coffee tastes burnt every morning. I am considering chalking the pot up as a loss and moving on to a different percolator.
The burnt flavor is the only negative thing I have to say about this coffee maker, but I deem it the most important thing I am looking for in any coffee maker. The Faberware percolator that we had before this one was great. It just got too old and finally wouldn't keep the coffee hot, forcing us to look for a new one. I will probably donate this one and look for another brand. I think this pot had potential, but I guess it just gets too hot and burns the coffee.",Casablanca42,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de julio de 2019
Electrifying!,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this percolator, after much research, in March 2010. After a bit of a learning curve in getting the strength right, it brewed great coffee and kept it hot without tasting burnt for hours. It does not get five stars because had quite a shock this morning. An hour or so after brewing our daily morning pot of coffee the safety outlet in the kitchen, that the percolator was plugged into, tripped and flipped the circuit breaker for the kitchen. After we reset the circuit breaker the light did not come back on the coffee pot. I thought maybe the cord had been bumped loose in resetting the safety outlet and so checked it's connection to the percolator. I received a shock, followed by a popping noise and white flame before I could unplug the cord from the outlet. The flame burned through one of the two cords that make up the larger cord just where it attaches to the plug that plugs into the percolator itself. Wow. We have always kept it on the counter, cord plugged into the percolator, but unplugged from the wall, so the cord wasn't wrapped or bent in a way that could damage it. As, with anything electrical I guess shock is a risk, but the perocolator plug end of the cord seems to be the weaker link in this model. Otherwise it was a great coffee maker, you can't beat stainless steel for ease of cleaning, and it really did make great coffee.

This is the second leaky Presto coffee pot we’ve purchased so I think we are done with this brand of coffee pot!

Doesn't last: thermostat or wiring fail,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I have used percolators forever. Best, hottest most reliable cup of coffee, to my taste. When my old workhorse percolator died about 10 years ago or so (I have no idea how old it was, that's how long I had it!) I began replacing it with these Prestos. When they work they are great! But I have noticed a pattern that after about 2-3 years the coffee begins to get weaker...and weaker, and the temp is not as hot. The thermostat is either failing or the wiring is shorting inside. I had one poop out the day before Thanksgiving- quit completely with a house full of guests. Ran to BB&B and got another Presto. This is a consistent pattern, as I have gone through about 4 of them and my 5th just failed. I keep buying them because I really love the coffee, ease of use and not having a big appliance taking up space on my small kitchen counter. So now I am looking at a cheap Mr Coffee, which I know will only last about 2- 3 years, but at about half the price of the percolator.",silverfish,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de abril de 2020
This coffee maker is highly rated on Amazon so like others I decided to replace my Farberware unit with ...,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee maker is highly rated on Amazon so like others I decided to replace my Farberware unit with Presto. Not happy. It makes coffee but it is terribly difficult to clean. The internal coffee container is made of a different steel, is NOT deep enough and absolutely demands a paper filter to be used which is simply terribly difficult to use. The Farberware unit cleans easily, has a deep coffee grind container that is smooth steel that cleans easily and doesn't demand a filter. Next the Farberware unit is TALL and the pour spout is completely different. The first time I used it coffee went everywhere except in the cup. Be careful on that first pour until you are used to it. Although it makes coffee it simply doesn't taste the same as the Farberware unit. The Presto is a good utility pot but for me it goes back on the shelf in case the Farberware unit dies, and it will because the new units are made in China but I still prefer the unit over Presto. I just have to buy one every two years. Four stars because I can't argue the unit is bad, it is just different and I personally hate the hard to clean internal grind container compared to Farberware.",james m edwards,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de diciembre de 2014

Unfortunately, even with my Starbucks coffee it didn't give that fresh flavor I experienced at my sisters. You could almost taste some of the metal flavored with the coffee. It was off putting (to myself). The heating element on it was fantastic though and it brewed coffee quickly. But for the cost and flavor it gave off I didn't think it was worth it to keep it. Also, I noticed when I cleaned it daily that you really have to scrub the bottom because the coffee will burn from sitting. Maybe the heating element was off on mine?

A blast from the past,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","After having drip coffee makers of all brands for years, I decided to get an old-school percolator for my office.

Not quite what I expected.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","So far it's a been a reliable coffee pot. I bought it 8 months or so. Dunno, maybe I'm overly picky.
My complaints:
1) The cord is quite short, plan on having the pot within 2 feet of an outlet.
2) There is no power switch so you have to plug and unplug it with every batch.
3) The spout attaches to the body which raises a seam, so you can not get that last ounce out.
4) While the wikipedia claims ""For example, a cup of brewed coffee in the U.S. is typically 6 U.S. fluid ounces."" Apparently Presto thinks it's 5, and that's before you make the coffee. It's more like 4.5 by the time it's done boiling. So for this 12 cup maker you add approximately 60 ounces of water and get out approximately 54 ounces of coffee out.. or approximately 9 normal (6 oz) cups out.
5) To prevent you from getting that last ounce out (to ease cleaning) it's got a lip at the top which tends to collect gunk.
6) I wish the warming when it's done percolating was optional, it's kinda annoying to have to listen for it to stop, then remove the plug... careful it's hot... if only there was a switch.

So basically I was hoping that for $40 it would have a more reasonable cord, an on off switch, and a heavier gauge steel for the body instead of a thin stamped body that needs to have a folded over lip to stand up to having the lid inserted/removed.",Bill Broadley,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de abril de 2011
Great coffee but lasted four month.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This made the best coffee ever. We admit, it was a pain in the butt to fill with coffee, with the damned filters and all. We hated the big filters at first and it took us a while to figure out how to do them properly. We wasted a few pots of coffee messing them up. Once we figured it out, we loved it. Fabulous coffee using larger grinds. We ended up switching to the easier round filters, one on the bottom and one on the top. That did help. Well, today the thing just stopped working and we have no idea why. Four months and done. Well, I have to say, it was worth it. We have hard water, so maybe that was it. I may buy the exact same one, I may not. I liked it. Takes longer to reload. We do it right after we finish the pot and clean it, so it's all ready for the next pot. We love coffee and we'll always use a percolator. Give this one a try if you want to.

Two Years of Service,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Well, two years and three weeks this coffee pot gave us decent coffee.
The coffee it perked was as good as you are at setting it up.
The pot did what it was supposed to do in that it made the coffee in the time it said it would (approximately 1 minute per cup, 12 cups perked in approximately 12 minutes)
Red light lite when completed. It did then go in to ""keep warm mode"" which kept the coffee piping hot.
I have to say, my opinion is, that two years of service just wasn't enough time in service.
We had bought it to replace our Farberware 12 cupper received as a wedding gift (married Jan. 01) so it served for 12 years faithfully. Tried to save a couple bucks buying this brand, guess you get what you pay for.
We replaced with the longer lasting brand.
I have to add the fact, we really used this pot and the prior, brew a minimum of a lot every day, 365 days a year. We even take the pot away on vacations, we love perked coffee.",Chappy,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de abril de 2017
Makes decent coffee but is not all stainless steel,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this percolator for my husband and one of the main reasons I did so is because it is advertised as being made from stainless steel. The pot and basket are stainless steel but the socket that the tube fits in to that shoots the hot water up to the basket is NOT. In fact, it is aluminum as is the nut that holds it in place. I did not realize this when purchased as these parts are a silver anodized colored to look like the stainless pot but they have oxidized and turned black in which residue comes off terribly when cleaning. NO, it's not from the coffee, it is oxidation and when you clean the pot with ""dip it"", it turns a grey color to which a magnet will not stick. Comparing this to an older Farberware brand, it is obvious the parts in question are not stainless steel. We've had this percolator for about 6 months and I'm back to order a new 12 cup Farberware as it still has an all stainless steel interior and we feel that if we are going to develop alzheimers later in life, it's not going to be from drinking aluminum oxide from this pot.",mcosby,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de octubre de 2012

So, the thing is covered under warranty for a year. Great for me? sort of. I have to mail it back, on my dime, to someplace in Mississippi, and then wait for them to send me a new one. How long will this take? who knows? and THAT is why it gets 3 stars. Hopefully people reading my review will take into consideration the entire process, not just the specific product. in my opinion, that is part of the whole experience.

"Great, until rust sets in","3,0 de 5 estrellas","My wife and I bought the Presto percolator after having problems with drip coffee machines over the years. We were initially thrilled with this coffee machine as compared to drip coffee makers previously owned. The coffee quality is fantastic, substantially better than what we were used to previously (and the great part is that ""normal"" coffee like Maxwell House tastes great - there is no need to buy whole bean and grind fresh for great coffee).

The main problem is that within a year, the prongs that connect to the cord have rusted and now make electrical sounds (like sizzling) when the cord is barely jiggled. We replaced the cord, thinking that would do the trick, but it looks as though the whole machine has to go. It really is a shame, I read many reviews on here that indicated people had owned this brand percolator for 20+ years with no problems. We have owned ours for about a year, and irreplaceable parts have rusted through. I wonder if Presto has changed the materials some of these pieces were made with? At any rate, we are not buying another.

Also, though it would be a minor point if the rust had not occurred, this machine is a pain to clean daily, since we would have to wash all the parts by hand (I forget if the internals are machine washable, but we don't run the washing machine daily, so it didn't matter).",Sententiae,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de octubre de 2010

Electrical connector poorly designed,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","This thing doesn't last very long because after a while water starts to rust the metal electrical connectors on the bottom, the plastic encasement of the electrical connectors chips off, and the unit malfunctions. It has several parts to it (the stick thing, the disc thing, the basket, the lid) which must be assembled to make the coffee. And sometimes if you don't set the stick thing exactly in the bottom in the middle of the carafe, it comes out as just hot water instead of coffee (but that's rare). I like it because it's all stainless steel --no plastic, no aluminum, so your coffee is not contaminated. I just wish it lasted longer. They need to design it so the electrical connector is protected from water damage. The way it is now is rather dangerous. This morning there were sparks coming from the electrical connector as I was fidgeting with it to try to get it to work.",Stephanie,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de junio de 2017
"Good coffee, pot lasts only 2 years","3,0 de 5 estrellas","I have owned three of these since 2008.

The Good: If you like percolated coffee, these make a good cup. Some here have mentioned grounds in the coffee, and that's true for me. But I use off-the-shelf Maxwell house. Someone here has mentioned grinding your own at the store on the ""percolator"" setting prevents grounds. I haven't gone to that trouble as the grounds settle to the bottom of the pot and don't bother me that much anyway. Anyway, the coffee is a good strong cup without a bitter taste.

The Other: The thing only lasts about two years. As I said I have owned three of these since 2008 and have just ordered my fourth one as the current pot is on its deathbed. They were $50 when I started buying them at Amazon. I didn't pay the $73 Amazon is currently asking, though. If I had to pay that much I would start searching for another model.

I can make coffee in my larger one with no filter and there are still very few grounds at the bottom so I took off 1 star for that. The flavor is very good but not great and the coffee is pretty hot but not as hot as my larger unit so another star subtracted. On the plus side, it brews quickly, takes up much less counter space, doesn't give off tons of steam like by drip unit so I can keep it under the counter with no worries, holds the coffee hot while plugged in, very easy to clean, and definitely looks better than most drip units.",Denise Pokrywka,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de junio de 2014

Awesome coffee maker but it only lasted only 2 years.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Awesome coffee maker but lasted only 2 years. I purchased this item in February 2015. I have loved it. Makes great tasting coffee. Nice and hot and for some reason the coffee did not taste ""burnt"" after several hours of sitting in the pot. Unfortunately the plug that attaches to the coffee maker and the prongs it connects too rusted somewhat. The prongs are not supposed to be immersed in water (which I didn't do) but its impossible to keep them dry with each wash. Anyway one day the pot perked but no water made it to the coffee holder. It happened several more times over the next few days and then it died completely. I dont think 2 years of use covered what I paid for the percolator.

The Presto does not make the coffee hot enough for my preference, but I do like my coffee very hot. I gave it a 3 star due to the fact that the tube in the middle of the basket has a rough edge, and in cleaning the basket, I have cut a knuckle on that rough edge a couple of times, enough to cause bleeding. It's as if the edge of the tube wasn't smoothed, or rolled enough to remove the sharp edge. So, now I just use a little more caution when cleaning the basket.

Cord issues,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","First, I do think that percolators make better, hotter coffee than drip so I have been very pleased with my decision to move to a percolator.

HOWEVER, there is something very wrong with the design when after such a short time (2 yrs?), the plug/cord stops working. I'm quite certain that it is from water getting into the connector area and then rusting and now I have to jiggle the connection until it works. The manufacturer needs to fix this.

UPDATE: I am now on my THIRD cord (purchased 2 replacements) and it is having problems. This last one only worked for a few months! Very frustrating.

... drinking water that was heated in plastic every morning like in our old coffee machine,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought this when I decided I didn't want to be drinking water that was heated in plastic every morning like in our old coffee machine. The coffee is not as strong from this machine so we add more coffee grinds than we did in our previous machine. Also it takes a little bit more time and effort to make our coffee in the morning. On the plus side, it's a durable and well made machine with no heated plastic leaching chemicals into our coffee so we'll keep it. Also I recommend buying the circular flat percolator filters because the grinds can clog the little holes in the bottom causing the basket to over flow grinds into your coffee. The fold over filters that come with the machine are too complicated for me to use in the morning, especially before I've had my coffee.",Filmstock,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de enero de 2015

"Good flavor, easy to use and clean","4,0 de 5 estrellas","The negative reviews on this item are ridiculous and mostly from reviewers who have no clue about perculators, how they are made, or how they work. Don't rely on this customer-driven review rating. Read online professional reviews of percs. This Presto perculator is always on the top of the list - for reasons!

NO! It is not 'corroding.' The bottom parts turn color, especially if you don't clean after each use. It's called chemistry. Perculators have always done that. Those review pics of dirty canisters are nasty - clean your perc more! You have to clean it and all the parts after each use. Too hard? Move back home with mom. Percs are extremely easy to clean and take less than a couple minutes.

NO! You're not getting Alzheimer's <eyes roll out of head>

YES! You get a small amount of grounds in every pot. That is a perc. You will never notice them. Getting a lot, like actually IN YOUR MOUTH? You aren't following instructions. You MUST follow instructions, use correct ratios, and use the CORRECT GRIND. Regular drip grind is fine. If you are still getting grounds in your mouth, then reread the instruction. I'm not sure how much easier a food prep device can be. This is not challenging.

This Presto pot is a classic. It functions as expected. No surprises. Great flavor, nice and piping hot.

Four stars for: needs an on/warm switch; needs a 1/2/4/8hr auto off switch; most importantly - needs a glass top to show the perculating! Don't be cheap Presto, a glass top would push this into a premium pot. As it is, it's basic and meh.

"Makes great coffee, but doesn't last long. Became a fire hazard.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is the fourth Presto percolator I bought for myself. It makes great coffee. My only complaint is that this model doesn't last long enough, especially now when you consider how expensive this appliance has become. The first one I bought lasted 4 or 5 years. The last couple only lasted about half of that. I strongly considered buying a different brand, but after reading articles and customer reviews, I decided that this one is probably still the best percolator, which, considering its short life span, isn't saying much. At least I never had a problem with the Presto percolator leaking or the handle breaking off. What it did do when it finally went kaput is heat up to a dangerous level of heat and not turn off. It just kept perking and perking. It was too hot to touch without getting a serious burn and was a fire hazard. It did that for the last two that I bought. Hopefully, this one won't do that.",Anonymous1,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de abril de 2023
Works good. Steel jug (not plastic). No paper filters needed.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this because it was the only coffee maker I could find that wasn't made of plastic. For a long time, I resisted buying this old ""percolator"" style of coffee maker, because of bad memories of the one my parents had. However, I finally decided the bad memories were less toxic than the plastic from my new ""space age"" coffee maker.

Anyway, the new percolator works fine. It is fairly idiot-proof. You don't need paper filters. I have an old Delonghi electric coffee grinder where you push a button to grind the coffee beans. I grind whole beans at home. About 12 short bursts on the handheld electric coffee grinder, and you have a nice coarse grind ideal for a percolator. A tiny amount of coffee grounds does leak from the filter into the pot, but so far, none of the coffee grounds have made it up the spout into my cup. The coffee tastes exactly the same as when I was using my old coffee maker.

The manufacturer (of course) recommends a total clean & wash of all the parts between each use. (ROFL.) I do a cold-water rinse, then rub the filter (inside and outside) with a terry-cloth towel. That keeps the holes in the filter from getting clogged.

The noise from the percolotor is annoying, but I expect I'll get used to it. I think it is not quite as fast as my previous coffee maker, but the coffee still brews by the time I finish my toast, so no worries.

The only thing I would change in the design, is how the kettle plugs in. On this model of coffee percolator, the electric cord plugs in directly at the base of the kettle. Every time you take the kettle to the sink to fill it, you need to unplug the cord. I also happen to own an electric kettle used to heat water for tea. On my electric kettle, there is a detachable base that plugs into the wall, and the kettle can be lifted on and off the base. This coffee maker does NOT have a detachable base; the heating element is built directly into the bottom of the kettle. You have to pull out the plug, then lug the whole thing out to the sink to fill it.

The cord that comes with the coffee maker is very short; this is supposed to be for safety, so the kettle won't get tipped over. I had to replace it with a longer cord (also for safety), because the short cord was sticking straight out from the wall where it could snag someone's arm. The longer cord lies flat against the wall, out of harm's way.",Clothes Monkey,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de mayo de 2016
Makes good coffee with correct amount of grounds,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",I have a nice 4 cup peculator but after retiring I needed a larger one. I first tried 4 cups in this Presto pot but it was strong. Turns out the 'cup' numbers on the inside of the pot are not correct (I assumed the numbers were cups). If you measure the water you find it is a 8 cup peculator when the water is at the inside number 12 . Putting in the correct coffee grounds for the measured amount of water fixed my 'to strong' problem. All in all the pot worked fine with the amount of grounds I like. It perks quickly and I like the light telling me when it is done. I only perked one pot so I will update after a couple weeks if anything changes.,M.

Presto #02811 12 cup coffee maker,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","We purchased this coffee maker, to replace our much-too-expensive drip maker for two reasons: The drip coffee maker made awful coffee, no matter what brand we used, even grinding our own beans. And when you would pour coffee from the pot, it ran down the sides of the pot in a stream...we had to hold it over the sink to pour a cup (a pathetic design on someone's part!) And we didn't really like the coffee very much from any of the other drip makers we previously owned. The coffee tasted fair, but we never thought it was really 'good'.

I thought of how good coffee was 'back in the day' before drip makers. My husband agreed it is much better coffee with a perculator, as he and his group use one with a campstove to make their coffee on their hunting trips each year. Soooo, we started looking, and checking reviews, and decided to try this one. PROS: It pours without a drip. It makes excellent coffee compared to our drip makers. It keeps the coffee hot until you use up the last cup and unplug it. CONS: It doesn't have an on/off switch. You plug it in to turn it on, unplug it to turn off. The filters need to be 'folded' over the stem, to keep the grounds out of the pot. (note: you can purchase the square filters with holes already punched for this, but we just use our regular drip maker paper filters (round with sides), put the coffee in, and fold each side down over the stem punching a hole with the stem to cover the grounds... only takes a few seconds and they work fine). I also found I need to use more coffee for this pot than for my drip maker, but it does taste so much better.

If you care more about good tasting coffee, than all the bells, whistles, timers, etc, I would suggest this pot. Takes some getting used to, to use it quickly and easily, but once you catch on to the filter-fold-over-thing to keep the grounds out.and how much coffee to use for the best flavor.. easy peasy.",S.

very good product,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is my 2nd Presto 02811 percolator. I've used it every day since July 2015. The heating element died on my previous one after years of daily use. So far, I've had to replace the electrical cord twice at an average cost of $7. I've also owned a Farberware percolator but it didn't have an indicator light.

This is how you get a great cup of coffee every time:

1) Get yourself an inexpensive burr grinder like the Hamilton Beach CM12.
2) Get yourself a thermal carafe that will hold at least 60oz of coffee.
3) Get yourself a cheap little digital scale that measures grams.
4) Buy only 100% arabica beans and take note of the roast (I like dark roast).
5) Forget about scoops per cup. Think in terms of 1.5 grams of coffee per ounce of water.
The Presto 02811 pot has markings on the inside for the water level. Presto defines a cup as 5oz.
That means 8 ""cups"" is 40oz of water. That means you use 60g of coffee beans for your grind.
10 cups = 50oz. That means 75g of beans. Easy formula.
6) Set the grinder to COARSE setting. For the CM12 that means setting 9. Don't grind the beans until you are ready to use them.
7) Once the coffee is done, the light will go on and the percolating will stop. Unplug the pot and transfer the coffee to the thermal carafe. It will keep for hours without reheating.

Extra tips:

- Try setting the grinder at a finer setting (like 8) and see if you like the taste. Don't go too fine or you will get a bitter taste. You may get some grind in the pour but I usually pour the coffee into the carafe thru a strainer so the larger grounds are filtered. You may also find some ""silt"" on the bottom of your cup. No big deal.

- Try your coffee without sugar and use heavy cream instead of milk. Don't overdo it. You want to taste the coffee.",Winston Callahan,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de marzo de 2018
"Great coffee, but not strong unless you limit # of cups","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I've had this percolator about two months. We like it so well we are purchasing another one for our vacation home. Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
Nice looking, easy to clean, makes HOT coffee that stays hot, flavor is fresh and clean, not burnt and muddy like you get in a drip coffee maker. Nice smell throughout the kitchen when it is brewing, and it brews very quickly.

Cons:
No ""sneak a cup"" while brewing (although it brews fast so that's not a big deal); no automatic shut off (although it is easy enough to purchase a timer plug that you can plug it into that can regulate shut off time). But the biggest problem for us is that it is impossible to brew more than 6 cups of really strong coffee. The basket is simply too small to be able to hold enough grounds to make strong coffee. The way we deal with this is just to brew six cups at a time, which is fine for two people because the cups are actual 8-oz cups, not 6-oz like the drip coffee makers. So we each get three full cups in the morning, which is all we need. But if you wanted to brew more than 6 cups, it will not be strong. This is the reason I gave it only 4 stars, otherwise I would give it 5.

For us we never have a problem with grounds leaking into the coffee. We use percolator-grind coffee; any finer and it will leak out (you cannot buy off-the-shelf bags of coffee, you either need to grind the beans at the store with their machine set to percolator grind or go to Starbucks or Peets and ask them to grind it at that level). We use a regular basket paper filter, we just poke a hole in the middle of it and it works fine, no need to buy the more expensive filters that come with the pot. But again, you cannot overfill the basket trying to get stronger coffee.",Nani G,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de octubre de 2012
"Good percolator so far, but don't bother with the recommended paper filters!","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I like this electric percolator so far. We'll see if it holds up. My previous percolator, a Farberware, only lasted a couple of years. I got this one, however, because the reviews indicate that it is well-made.

Minor criticism: The cup demarcations are embossed inside the coffee pot and are easy to read. The problem is they are demarcated in 5-oz. increments, like Mr. Coffee machines. Why do coffee makers so often use 5-oz. cup measurements? Directions on coffee packages always assume 6-oz. cups (usually one tablespoon per cup). It's no big deal, but I did have to convert in my head for the first several pots. It's just annoying.

Also, please note: The instructions recommend using paper coffee filters. I've never in my life used filters for percolators! Isn't that one advantage of percolators over drip makers? One review said you need to use them to prevent grounds from getting in the coffee and/or clogging up the metal strainer. It's true that a small amount of grounds usually get in the coffee when you percolate. If anything, with this maker, I've noticed fewer grounds.

I did give the filters a try. I used the Melita filters that the instruction manual recommended. Not only was it a pain—the metal strainer is too small a space to add grounds inside of the filter without spilling coffee on the counter—it actually changed the flavor of the coffee for the worse. Some of what I prefer about the flavor of percolators is lost when I used filters. I read something about how the filters remove ""coffee oils."" I don't know what coffee oils are, but I obviously like the flavor that they provide.

All that to say, don't use filters! Using normal store-bought coffee, which by default is a medium grind, the strainer is easy to clean without clogging up the tiny holes. No trouble whatsoever. A finer grind might cause more trouble, but if you're buying coffee in the Folgers/Maxwell House/Yuban/Chock Full 'O Nuts families, you'll have no problems.",Brent White,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de junio de 2015

Too Short percolate time,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",I would have given five Stars but I feel like percolate is too little short. If I wanted regular coffee I would have bought a regular coffee pot.

It's all about the coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I've been playing with mine for a while. Paper filters soak up the coffee oils/flavor. I put a French press screen in the bottom of the basket and another on top without the basket lid. Grind your own beans as bag ground is too fine and can't keep up resulting in blow outs and grounds everywhere. Also, don't pour a cup as soon as it's ready to allow the grounds in the basket to drain. I'm a lover of dark/french roast but this machine does not make it taste right. I switched to a medium roast beans today and it made the world of difference.",Jenne S.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de mayo de 2023
Stove top is better,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I love percolator coffee and all and I had a stove top percolator but would take about 40 min to make coffee, this one takes about 7 minutes but it's not that strong, also a LOT of coffee grounds get in the coffee, and if I use a filter the coffee is even weaker, so my friends and I never want to be the last one to get coffee because that's the cup that'll have all the grounds, and the only coffee I buy is finely ground. I like it that it still tastes good and is really quick, I just don't like the grounds, I think it's a problem with the basket because every time I go to clean the percolator the basket has grounds all down the sides so that tells me the rod isn't tall enough and is spouting up the lid of the basket and letting grounds come out the top, when the grounds only fill halfway up the basket. It is very pretty though and easy to clean. I'll probably just have to use filters and let the pot run through twice. There was one day that I ran the pot twice and I have no idea why but when I poured it it was just plain water! And the grounds were all wet as though they'd been used but it was pure water no coffee! It was only that one day but extremely weird and the pot was hot and making noise and nothing was clogged, extremely weird. If I had to choose again I would choose the best selling stove top percolator over this one because my experience with that one is extremely positive and I can let it brew for as long as I want and let the coffee get stronger!",Chalupa Troopa,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de junio de 2016

"Good coffee, bad cord construction","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Makes excellent coffee, though I do add more than is recommended as I like my coffee rich. I used the 5 little filters it came with. When they ran out I just use the regular drip coffee filterers (8-12 cup size) and cut a tiny hole in the bottom. Occasionally there have been coffee grounds in the bottom so I simply do not drink the very last of the coffee.

Edit: Well it has been exactly 2 years that i have been using this (actually with time off for using my Nespresso machine) and the Presto is almost at its end of use. The cord seems to have worn out; I need to jiggle it to get the machine to work. I paid a fairly high price for this; I see it is now offered at a significant lower price. I am going to search other brands before re-ordering this as it should have lasted more than 2 years.

Edit 1/18: (Raised my rating from 3 to 4 stars for longevity and good-tasting coffee): I have now used the Presto for nearly 3 years. I had to replace the cord (about $8) but the replacement is just as bad. It does work, though, you just have to make sure the cord does not fall out/get too jiggley. The coffee is still delicious.

I bought my mother the H-B brand percolator as a gift. It is more sturdy/stable than the Presto, but the common complaint in the reviews seems to be the grounds that always get in to the coffee. Same thing happens with my mother's machine. When my Presto wears out I may need to try a 3rd brand.",Eden Elizabeth,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de mayo de 2015

Makes a very good cup (better than drip)!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I spent some time in Europe. Once you've gotten used the strong and robust coffees over there, there is no going back. I had an electric espresso pot for years which finally burned out. It used percolation versus drip as well. My Keurig drip is good but not great, so I purchased this unit. It arrived quickly, and looks/works great. Coffee is very good, better than drip, but still not fantastic like overseas. I've tried a couple of pots, various amounts of grounds. I go 2-3 Tbsp per cup. I've tried with and without filters, and had no issues with grounds in the coffee. Overall a nice addition to my kitchen coffee bar. I would have liked to see a longer cord, and maybe a selectable automatic shut-off feature. Time will tell if the unit is built to last, but unlikely. These days I seldom find anything that makes it more than 3 years, or it dies just past warranty, as if specifically designed to do so. My folks have a Mr. Coffee and a GE oscillating fan, both 50 years old, still going strong.

Better than drip! Need coarse grinds!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",Love percolated coffee! This is a nice economical pot. Coffee tastes good. My only complaint is the basket holes allows grinds to get into the coffee. I don’t want to buy separate filters for this as it should work without them. My other percolator with brand that starts with “f” doesn’t have this issue. They need to redesign the basket. I’ve tried grinding up coffee beans on a coarser setting and this helps.

"Great coffee pot, makes strange noises","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this to replace my now dead Farberware. After reading reviews about how shoddy the Farberware has gotten and the fact the 12 cupper is at least $20 more than this one, I gave the Presto a shot. Observations:

1. The dang thing makes some odd noises. The first time I used I thought someone was shooting at me (sounds like richocheting bullets). Then my wife came out of the other end of the house and asked ""Did one of the dogs just throw up ?"". Yeah, it made a dog puking noise. Rather funny. We got used to it.

2. Had to experiment with filters to keep the grounds out of the perked coffee. Standard flat filters are OK but I did get grounds in the coffee. Then I tried the wrap around ones that came with it - what a hassle and it still got some grounds in the coffee. Then I got a box of the basket filters that are made for the Mr Coffee type makers, drilled a hole through the center bottom of the whole stack of them, that did it! No more grounds in the coffee.

3. Due to the narrow spout, the coffee comes shooting out a ways from the maker, you really have to take aim to keep it going into the cup (or carafe). This is an issue as my wife is blind and now she can't really pour out of the pot since she can't really take aim like a sighted person can. What a shame. So I pour into the carafe and everybody's happy.

4. This 12 cupper makes noticeably more volume than the Farberware 12 cupper. I guess not everybody's cup size is the same (???).",ScottHW,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de abril de 2012
"BEST COFFEE, But Machine Does Not Last","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Long time percolator users here. This is our SECOND Presto. The first one was purchased in August of 2021 and didn't even last two years. However, we tried another brand and it simply didn't get hot enough, made weak coffee, and a host of other things. This PRESTO makes HOT coffee, you control the strength (we like strong) and the coffee STAYS hot. You need to have coarse ground coffee, fine will just seep through the basket. The prongs on the pot do tend to get rusty and the cord can get the same, so keep the outside dry.

Brews really hot coffee,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I've had two Faberware coffee pots which I loved because they brew really fast. However, over time the element starts to go out so the pot doesn't get hot enough, the coffee is weak, and you have to re-brew or pour into your cup and then microwave it because it's not hot enough out of the pot. When my second Faberware pot completely stopped working I decided to try this Presto model. It takes about 11 minutes to brew 8 cups, it has a light that tells you when the coffee is ready, it brews just the strength that I like it (dark but not bitter dark) and it's really hot coming out of the pot, which I like because I add a little milk to my coffee and it's still hot after adding the milk. The one thing to watch out for is the spout length. The Faberware pot has a very short spout, so consequently when pouring your cup is close to the pot. This pot has a very long spout, so several times the stream of coffee has overshot my cup and once it scaled my hand. I'm getting used to the spout now, but that's something to watch out for, especially if you have been used to model with a very short spout.",Dale S.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de abril de 2020
Best affordable alternative to plastic coffeemakers!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I was looking for an all stainless coffee maker and this one fits the bill. The percolator hole at the bottom is aluminum but its likely only used because aluminum is better at transferring heat.

It makes pretty good tasting coffee. I would hesitate to say its THAT much better than a comparatively priced drip maker but I guess taste is subjective.

Overall operation is pretty simple. It comes with a few paper disc filters but I do not think they are necessary unless you grind your coffee into powder. I use plain Maxwell House and only get a few grounds at the bottom of a pot without a filter. It also makes coffee pretty quick. I don't know exactly how long but you can be drinking a cup of coffee in under 10 minutes. Its noticeably faster than drip makers I've used.

Whats keeping this from being a 5 star is about coffee burning. It burns coffee fairly quickly once you have a pot brewed and a few cups out of it. Most coffee makers will burn coffee eventually but its a bit disappointing this one will do it so quickly. My old Mr Coffee wouldn't burn until less than half the pot was gone. Now after I pour my first couple cups I transfer it all to a thermos.",Average Joe,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 8 de marzo de 2020

Bon produit en général,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Nous avons changé notre cafetière filtre pour ce percolateur électrique. Nous sommes assez satisfait de notre achat. Ça prend un certain ajustement afin de déterminer la quantité de café avec la bonne mouture par tasse mais une fois la bonne recette trouvée, c'est vraiment parfait et on adore le goût du café riche. On ne met pas de filtre pour conserver tout l'arôme du café donc la mouture doit être plus grossière qu'une cafetière filtre afin d'éviter d'avoir des grains dans le café. Le mieux est d'avoir un moulin à café chez soi afin de pouvoir gérer facilement la mouture.

Les plus :
Facile à nettoyer et utiliser
Ancun contact du café avec du plastique fait entièrement de stainless et un peu d'aluminium
Café qui reste chaud pour toute la durée que la cafetière est branchée.
La cafetière prend très peu d'espace sur le comptoir et est très jolie

Les moins :
-Aucune switch on/off donc il faut la débrancher pour qu'elle arrête de fonctionner.

Presto 02811 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","After perking the first coffee, my initial reaction was to return it. Coffee was very weak, almost no color, and the taste was worse than my Keurig. However, with almost a month to test it, I used it again. The second time, the coffee was ""almost"" as good as the coffee made in my childhood pot (which still works) and I'm 71 years old. I have continued to use the pot and the coffee gets better. I'm beginning to think this coffee maker is like a cast iron skillet, i.e., it has to age. I only rinse it after each use and will use vinegar and baking soda to clean it after so many uses. I am beginning to love this coffee maker as much as my childhood coffee pot. I highly recommend you give it a chance because it makes GREAT coffee!

7/2/2023 Update -- I'm still in love; I use regular filters. I fold them in half twice and snip the tip off. Works great. I use them for easy clean up. Still highly recommend this for anyone who wants great coffee. The Keurig and drips are stored away.

Very short cord but a good brew,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This replaces a 5-yr old Cui$1nart percolator that got daily usage. The lid to the old machine kept breaking and it finally just stopped percolating my coffee, even though it was regularly washed thoroughly. Dealing with their customer service was like pulling teeth so I decided to go with the Presto.

The overall design is similar to my old perk, although the innards are made of a much thinner stainless steel. So far it hasn’t warped. My biggest peeve is that the cord is so darned short! Doesn’t work on my counter top without me rearranging things and letting it sit underneath the top cupboards (I’m sure the steam/heat is not good for the wood!)

This brews a good cup of coffee (French press takes the gold.) Normally I don’t bother with any coffee filters but no matter how coarsely I grind the coffee, grounds seem to end up in the brew. So I’ve started using one on the bottom of the basket and it has helped keep the grounds out of my cup.

I’ve only had it for a month but so far so good, other than the above issues. Time will tell if this was a wise purchase.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de octubre de 2019

The new one was making our coffee very weakly, like tea no matter how much coffee I put in. I looked at the basket up to the light so it back lights the holes & there was the problem:a number of holes aren't punched thru or are covered by a finish. I compared the new basket to the old one and it was clearly obvious that this is a problem. Presto has a quality control problem. I switched to the old basket in the new percolator and problem solved. Hubby took a wire to the new basket and easily corrected it after about 5 minutes of piercing thru holes. Shouldn't have to tho.

Better than a coffee maker,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this to replace my coffee maker. I was sick of buying a new, expensive coffee maker every year. The more high tech they are the worse they are. So, I decided to go low tech and old fashioned. As soon as I received the percolator I made about half a pot of coffee. It made coffee faster than a regular coffee maker and the smell was wonderful! The coffee was more robust and had a flavor that was not there with the coffee makers I have tried. This was my first time using a percolator and I found it to be very easy. I also used a coffee filter with it since I have heard a small amount of grounds can escape without the use of a filter. A regular filter worked fine. I do not see a need in buying a special filter for this since you can just poke holes and stuff it where you need to. The only thing I miss is the ""beep"" when the coffee is done brewing. But with this you know when the ""percolating sound"" stops and the red button lights up. It takes up much less room than a coffee maker and can easily be stored away in a cabinet when not in use. The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the disappointing fact that when I received this I read on the box ""Made in China"". I hope we don't get poisoned. Amazon really should make a point to advertise where a product is made. I prefer to buy my items ""Made in the USA"" for obvious reasons.",red.spqr,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de febrero de 2012
Cord cracked after 17 months,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Hello, so it has been 17 months since I purchased this coffee maker. As a rule I normally don't pull out the electric plug from the unit and rinse my pot over the sink without wetting the plug. That's to ensure I do not damage the cord by pulling it and plugging it numerous times so it may last me. However, today I was brewing and saw that the wire going into the neck of the plug going into the machine started to spark and smoke slightly now that should indicate that the wire has been pulled way too many times which is not the case with me because I rarely take it out also I always grasp the neck plugged into the unit so I do not pull on the cord so long story short sorry I believe that it's kind of a malfunction of the cord itself. (UPDATE) I spoke with the company and they bent over backwards to right the cord problem. I have to applaud them for their hard work and diligence.

one our hard water can't destroy!!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","We have hard city water and every coffee maker we would get (Bunn, Cuisanart, etc) would last 6 months at the VERY most before I was deliming it every week to no avail.
We love percolated coffee while camping so it only made sense to us to go with a percolator for the home. Less parts to get gummed up with crud. And it makes a great cup of coffee, very fast.
We have had this percolator for about 5 months and i really like it. Its easy to clean, and it hasn't gummed up on me yet.
A few helpful hints....get the correct grind of coffee. Too fine and you get grounds outside the basket, too large and you get weak coffee. Make sure you seat the post into the hole in the bottom of pot or you get hot water instead of coffee ( hubby and i have each done this once....) we also use a percolator filter paper in our basket. If you don't know what they look like, they are little circles with a hole punched out for the post and they fit perfectly in the bottom of the basket. also with this pot when you put the basket and post in the pot of water it sits up a bit out of the pot.

Good Coffee...A Pain To Make,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This pot delivers an excellent cup of coffee, but be prepared to work and wait for it. Compared to a drip coffee maker, the process of making coffee in this thing is rather a pain in the butt. It's the darned, ""wrap around the grounds"" filter method that makes preparation seem like so much more of a pain. I just HATE that step, and if you loathe grounds in your coffee, there's really no avoiding using filters. Also, I hate that you cannot set this pot to brew with a timer, like you can most drip machines. It would be much easier to deal with setting the pot up in the evening, rather than fumbling through the process in the morning...BEFORE I've had any coffee. Yikes! Finally, I don't like that there is no way to ""pause and serve"" on this style pot. Ten minutes (approximate brew time) isn't that long, but can seem like an eternity when waiting for your ""coffee fix"". Anyway, I suppose it's a give and take here, if you're a very discriminate coffee drinker who simply must have percolated coffee, and your willing to deal with the aforementioned cons, then it's a good pot...it does produce a bit of a richer, deeper flavor.

Very Good Percolater,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I had tried Death Wish Coffee, but was told that I absolutely had to percolate that brand. The Presto was my selection, and I think I made a great choice. Almost instantly upon plugging it in, it starts to percolate. Within 10 or so minutes, it is all done. I have both kept the grounds inside of it for the entire pot, and taken them out. It functions the same. And if I have half a pot left the next day, I can turn it back on (with the basket removed) and it will heat up the left over coffee in 5 minutes. The only caveat I have noticed with a percolator, is that more coffee grounds are needed than in a drip machine. 3 FULL scoops are needed for 10 cups.

The only reason I don't give 5 stars... is because I was given an all glass Percolator a couple months ago, that goes on the stove top... which has allowed me to slowly percolate the coffee for 15-20 minutes, resulting is fantastically strong coffee, with absolutely zero bitterness (the difference in a percolator, versus a drip).

Coffee tastes great!,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Looks very cool, quality material (stainless). Wish it had a clear glass knob like the old school ones, so you could see the magic happening. The top is a snug fit and it you definitely want to use both hands when removing it to avoid getting burned.

It's a (very minor) hassle to put together the brew basket, stalk, etc., to brew coffee compared to how spoiled we are with the two simple plastic parts of my recently defunct Mr. Coffee. And it takes a (very) few extra minutes for coffee to brew. I can't just toss it in the dishwasher like my old glass carafe and plastic basket.

But it looks cool, brings back good old memories from childhood, and, best part: I immediately noticed the coffee tastes INFINITELY better than the junk I've been drinking out of cheap drip machines the past 40 years.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de marzo de 2021

No Automation but Stainless Steel Wins,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Coming from a completely automatic, easy to load, easy to fill, machine, this percolator is, by comparison, finicky. I fight with the filter, cautiously load it with coffee, strain to see the inside markings to fill the pot with water, search for the depression in the bottom to insert the stem. But then, I plug this little gem in, listen to it croon, huff and puff, and after a short period of time, pour myself a gloriously deep, rich cup of java that was well worth the effort, while comforted by the fact that the only thing hot water touched was stainless steel, which is my priority. If your priority is automated ease, this is not the pot for you. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a completely stainless steel machine that delivers a satisfying cup of coffee, this percolator delivers in spades. The shiny exterior makes it pretty enough on the counter, and I find it easy enough to clean. Coffee stays piping for a couple of hours. I have tested this, but I usually put a full 12 cups of coffee in a pump thermos, so I don't test it daily. A full pot takes about 7 minutes. For where it sits on my counter, the light and cord are on the wrong side. Again, I don't care. It's stainless steel. If I were scoring on end product alone, this pot would get five stars.

Not Bad..,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a pretty good percolator. It brews smooth coffee and it does it quickly. Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
- Brews coffee quickly, in under ten minutes. A lot faster compared to my old drip coffee maker.
- It looks beautiful on the counter tops. No issues with the shine so far either.
- The coffee tastes better than with a drip coffee maker. It's not as bitter.
- You can use the circular, flat, or square coffee filters for this. At most, you'll have to put a small hole in the bottom of the filter to get it to fit.

Cons:
- No on and off switch and no timer. I get up for work at 4 am, and it'd be nice to wake up to fresh coffee. I can't preset it the night before.
- You can't just reheat the coffee in the percolator. It'll re-percolate it if you plug it in.
- The coffee isn't as strong compared to a drip coffee maker. We have to add in an extra scoop or two of coffee to get it strong enough.

It does not get heavy use, but I use it about 1-3 times/week and I really enjoy having it and it is easy to care for. We have a Keurig at our office, and I hate the coffee that it makes. To me the percolator provides a smoother coffee that tastes better and adds some welcome nostalgia. I used to love watching my mother making coffee for dinner guests. Our percolator had the glass top so you could see the coffee perking. That along with the old commercials for percolators made me want one again. Some people might not like that there are grounds at the bottom of the pot which typically end up in your cup--but I don't mind. Personally, I enjoy the perked coffee experience (along with grounds) and special memories of my mother that it connects me with. I did not buy one with a clear plastic top because of the negative reviews that I read. I would have given this one 5 stars if it had a glass top. :)",Karen,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de agosto de 2018
Only have one complaint after 4 years,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This has been a good coffee maker. The reason I got it was I can't find a coffee maker that does't have BPA in the plastic part where the HOT water goes! Sure wish a coffee maker company would come up with one!! I bought this almost 4 years ago and no problems. Just recently has it begun to not be up to par...coffee isn't quite as hot as it should be and everything has to be just right as far as the basket being filled and no grounds at all anywhere else, or it doesn't perk right. I pour and I get muddy water (hasn't gone over the grounds). YUK! So I have to refill and do it again. Not fun first thing in the morning! So I am thinking I need to get another one. I probably will get the West End one only because you can see the water level as you fill it up. That's my only complaint about the Presto. You have to peer down in the maker to see where the water level is and late at night, that's not easy. So I'm trying the West End only for that reason.",debbiem,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de febrero de 2018
Looking for some longevity,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I read hundreds of reviews while shopping for a bigger coffee maker. We have a 5 cup programmable drip, and it's been fine. Like most, it's mostly plastic. Its usually the plastic that breaks from all the use but it was less than $20.
Well, when we have company we need a bigger pot. I decided to go old school with a stainless steel percolator. So far so good, the coffee is about 10 degrees hotter, and more flavorful. It takes a little longer to set up, the numbers on the inside of the pot are a bit hard to read, and a little longer to clean but a great cup of coffee is well worth it.
I brewed without a filter and the grounds that came through were minute, only in the last bit of coffee. I did try using a 4 cup paper basket with a hole punched in the middle and it worked perfectly, no grounds at all.
I'm very happy with our purchase",elcheapofl,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de noviembre de 2019

I took off a star because the heating element for the warmer (not perk) will eventually die and it cools off and then re-perks all morning.

Not the best for camping/travel unless you have a generator,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I really like this percolator! It’s very easy to use and to clean BUT I bought it just for camping and it requires a 125v or 800 watts which is way more than what my car plug or our inverter can handle. You need a generator to be able to power this coffee maker. I spent all morning walking around our camp site trying to find someone who had an outlet that could handle the wattage.
Also- I bought a mesh basket to put the coffee grounds in but I really like the little filter bags they provided when I bought the coffee maker. The paper filter had a whole in the middle and a hole in each corner so the coffee grinds stay in the filter pouch.
It is a very nice coffee maker and made delicious coffee but not the best for traveling or camping unless you have a generator.",Clinton Wangsnes,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 30 de agosto de 2020

The coffee is much hotter than drip coffee. I use fine grounds with the filter and only a tiny amount get filtered through. The pros: easy to clean, nice looking, hot coffee, stainless steel. Cons: price, short electric cord, no on off button (it will light up red when done). I make 8 cups and use 3 to 3.5 tablespoons and it is plenty strong for me. You can use your old filters and trim them to size as well. The cord can unplug so you can transport it to another area.

"Makes great, hot coffee (except leaves some grinds)","4,0 de 5 estrellas","We bought this coffee maker to replace our 70's GE vintage percolator, that had belonged to my mother-in-law. We realized how much we love percolators. So when our old one finally gave out, we decided on the Presto brand.
We love it, as it makes great hot coffee. It also brews it relatively quick and looks nice on our countertop. The only reason I am giving it a 4 is because of the grinds it leaves behind. The maker came with a little package of percolator filters (new for me). In the instructions, it does say that you will have a clearer, nicer cup of coffee if you use the filters. And that is true. The problem is, is that I don't want to fuss with these tedious style filters. I rarely use them and the coffee still tastes great. We are just left with more grinds than our old GE percolator.

Presto or Cuisinart 12-Cup,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","When it comes to preparing coffee, I have run the full gamut. I started with a percolator, then when the Mr. Coffee came out I started using that. After that came the Keurig and now I am back to the percolator. While I enjoyed the convenience of the Mr. Coffee and Keurig they never seem to give me the full body flavor that I enjoyed.

I have now switched back to a percolator. I actually tested both the Presto 02811 12-Cup and the Cuisinart PRC-12 Classic 12-Cup. To quickly cut to the chase in my opinion the only difference is the cost. The bottom line with any coffee maker is the taste. And with either of these percolator’s you will get an excellent cup of coffee.

I'm not going to go into many of the details as they are pretty routine and the only slight difference is that the Cuisinart has a glass knob on top. Sort of a throwback to us nostalgia buffs. Personally, I don't consider this feature would merit the extra cost; therefore, I would recommend the Presto 02811. But you will find a good piping hot cup of coffee from either.",Joseph P,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de diciembre de 2015
"Finally, a decent cup.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Are you paying the equivalent of a gallon of gas for a plastic lidded papercup of drive-through flavored hot water? Tired of your morning coffee dripped through a paper filter or injection diluted through a premeasured plastic cup? Those devices don't make real coffee, but this percolator makes a real and honest brew. It comes with a few paper filters to line the basket, but they aren't needed if you can tolerate an occasional smattering of grounds in the bottom of the pot. The thought of using paper to line a percolator basket must be a marketing ploy to entice diehard drip coffee maker users. Absolutely unnecessary. A coffee cup is about 5-6 oz and count on one minute of percolating per ""cup"". Less actual ground coffee is needed compared to a drip coffee maker. One star reduction for the awkward seating of the stem in the percolator base and the incredibly short power cord. Even with those minor drawbacks, the reality of delicious coffee and without any other accessories easily justify the slight sticker shock of the price for such a retro appliance.

all about the balance,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","the pros:

it makes a smooth and enjoyable cup of coffee, i like the noises it makes, it looks good, and it's fairly easy to clean.

the cons:

it took several times for us to find the right balance of grounds and water to make a great cup of coffee. just one tablespoon off in one direction makes coffee that was much too weak. one tablespoon off in the other direction, the coffee is not good anymore. i hesitate to use the phrase ""too strong,"" because i can't have my coffee ""too strong,"" i love strong coffee. but with this coffee maker, i've found that i don't like the coffee if i add an extra tablespoon of coffee.

it's also impossible to tell how much coffee is left in the coffee maker when serving, which is not ideal when sharing a pot with others. you never want to take the last drop if you know someone else wants some more, right? or, you want to be able to split up the remaining coffee evenly, right? with this coffee maker, you can't really do either.

I am able to easily use the SAME paper basket filters by folding them into quarters and then snipping the center point with scissors to make a hole large enough to allow the basket stem to go through. No fancy filters required AND I can continue to buy the unbleached ones! What I love about this pot is how HOT the coffee is once it is brewed. My Mr. Coffee could never do that! By pairing this coffee pot with the Belkin Conserve Socket Energy-Saving Outlet with Timer (F7C009) I added the convenience of auto-shutoff to the coffee pot.

"3 Years old, How I clean it and and make my coffee","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I’ve been making coffee with this percolator for 3 years now. It’s the longest lasting one I’ve used. Here are some tips I recommend for maintaining and making great coffee:

1. Grind your own beans with a burr grinder on coarsest setting.
2. Do not fill percolator more than last #12 cup line if making 12 cups.
3. I use a paper filter (brown) by folding it 2x’s, then cut a tiny bit off of bottom to make a small hole that will slide down the metal filter rod.
4. Add leveled coffee grinds using tablespoon. Water/ground coffee grinds
ratio: 4 cups water-3 tablespoons
6 cups water- 5 tablespoons
8 cups water- 7 tablespoons
10 cups water- 9 tablespoons
12 cups water- 11 tablespoons
5. Clean every 1-2 weeks, otherwise grinds will rise over filter and spill into coffee as it percolates. To clean: fill with water to 8 cup line, place all parts back in and fill 1/4 of the filter with some Cascade Complete or baking soda, put filter lid on with top and turn on. Let percolator cool down before wiping down inside and using tubing brushes to clean where needed. Rinse out several times. If your percolator needs another cleaning, repeat cleaning when percolator is completely cooled down.

Update on 3/18/23:
Percolator is still working perfectly! I’ve changed the time frame for cleaning and how I clean it. I clean it every 3-4 weeks using Cascade dishwasher liquid:
1. Fill percolator to 12 cup line with water
2. Place first 2 parts inside, then squeeze about 4 tablespoons of Cascade liquid dishwasher detergent into the metal basket (where the coffee grinds go)
5. Place lid over metal basket, then put the lid on top and push in place.
6. Plug in percolator and let it run a brewing cycle.
7. Pour out all liquid and rinse.
8. Repeat cleaning process again and allow to cool.
8. Keep liquid inside so that you can clean the pot with a toothbrush and pipe brush for all parts and scrub inside of percolator.
9. Pour out as you continue to clean to the bottom.
10. Rinse with clean water a few times, then fill with fresh water to 12 cup line and allow for another brewing cycle.
11. You may want to run through 1 more fresh water brewing cycle to make sure the Cascade detergent is completely gone.
Note: If your percolator has grinds at the top basket lid or at the bottom of your percolator, it’s time to clean it. Hope this information helps to keep yours running for years!!!",jah,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de abril de 2020
Very happy with this Presto Model,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Just thought I would add some comments to perhaps clear up any confusion. My Presto 12 Cup Percolator has been in use for about a week now, and I'm very happy with the purchase. The shipment was double boxed, common of how Amazon ships. All arrived well, no problems.

The Materials used on my Unit are indeed all Stainless Steel, the Urn, Lid, Basket, and Stem. Construction and quality is first rate, and solid throughout,

The Coffeemaker does as it claims, I make 8 cups, and in just a tad over 8 minutes, the small light comes on indicating the brew cycle has finished.
The Coffee is nice and hot, a dislike I've always had with virtually all drip type makers.

Cleanup is extremely easy, all parts clean up just like new with dish soap in the sink, and the Stainless Steel seems quite impervious to any staining. I have noted no issues with the holes of the Basket clogging up at all in any instance, and I have used the machine both with filters, and without. The filters I have tried, and work very nicely on the basket, are the small 3.5"" Melitta Disc Paper Filters. I have only used standard off the shelf all purpose ground Coffees so far, and really see no need to run out and grind coarser grinds for this Percolator. It is not required IMO.

Although there is no brew strength adjustment, nor as some other vintage Percolators may have had in the past, like a water temp adjustment provision on the bottom, I personally really see no need for such, and that it is a basic simple process to add-subtract coffee amounts till personal tastes are met. I find that I use pretty much the very exact same amounts of coffee as I had with the Drip Type Makers.

The Coffee Flavor is smooth, very little in the way of sediment noted, even without the use of filters. I always remove Basket and Stem after Brewing to insure no alteration of strength

To add to this Percolator's convenience, I simply purchased a small DIgital Brinks Programmable Timer at Walmart for $9 that Plugs into an AC Outlet, and the Percolator can then be precisely set to the hour-minute to both turn on, and to turn off. A simple Timer which is working well, and very easy to program. Thus, I prepare the Percolator the night before, and have fresh Coffee waiting when I wake in the morning. The auto off feature of the timer then prevents the maker from staying on for too long a time, in which some may forget to unplug the machine later. This may help prevent future failures of the maker by excessive heat generated caused by no coffee in the Urn.

About the only little minor gripe, is no Glass Cap like the Percs of old had, but of course this does nothing to influence the flavor of the coffee. There is a small ""cup"" made into the inside of the Presto's Lid which helps disperse the hot water over the top of the Basket Lid.",MARK D.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de junio de 2015
Makes STRONG coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Compared to our last percolator, this unit makes really nice strong coffee. The basket is bigger and wider for more water flow.

Best I've found at a reasonable price,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Best coffee maker I've found. Been using it everyday now for 2+ years without worry of my hard water clogging clogging it like those cheap plastic drip machines. So pleased, I ordered a second one for work. Don't know why anyone would ever go back to the drip machines!

Pros:

* All metal aside from a hard plastic base. Coffee never comes in contact with plastic, and I strongly believe this leads to a much better tasting coffee.
* Metal percolator style has no issues with clogging over time. With my very hard water I seemed to be throwing away those plastic drip style makers every 6 months. With the Presto percolator there's no more weekly cleaning with vinegar! With this percolator, I just do semi-regular washing with dish soap as any semi-civilized man would. I might consider starting to occasionally clean the bottom of the chamber with vinegar, but even that doesn't seem necessary. There's little to no scale buildup after two years use!
* Coffee is brewed HOT, almost too hot but I refuse to consider that a negative since you can let it cool if you wish.
* Cleanup is a breeze! No hidden nooks and crannies you can't get at.
* Price point is good. Not the cheapest machine on the market, but it will pay for itself many times over by not clogging.
* It sounds and smells better. No burnt coffee smell at the start and no annoying gurgling at the end like you get from drip machine. It gives off a great brewed coffee smell, and while it does make a fairly distinct ""Clank-Shrew"" sound through-out the brew, I consider that a positive. It lets you know it means business!
* A simple design, and strong build quality all around.

Cons:

* None worth ever considering another pot over! But there are a few things worth noting:
* Filters are a bit tricky and until you get the hang of it, you might find some coffee grounds in the bottom of your cup. I use the square filters with the holes at the corners that you fold over center shaft. They take a few seconds longer to get filled and folded over to make a good seal where the grinds won't escape, but I'd never let this persuade me to go back to drip style makers.
* It takes a few minutes (maybe 5?) to brew a pot, and until the entire pot is brewed, you can't sneak out a cup like you would from a drip style maker. The full pot brew time is probably less than the drip style. Have some patience, it's worth it!
* The coffee comes out too hot for me to drink without letting it cool a minute or two. I don't consider this a ""con"" though and others might well consider it a ""pro"".
* It does have a hard plastic base, but whadya gonna do? It's solid and doesn't come in contact with the coffee.",C. HACKMAN,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de diciembre de 2014
Makes great coffee.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I had a similar design coffee pot that lasted 35 years and finally bit the dust to my dismay. The kind made to last . I took a chance on this coffee pot with some reticence since most things are disposable junk today. It was more expensive than the usual pots but heck, Amazon has returns. It makes good, hot coffee. The only thing I don't like is it has the most awkward filters that have to be bundled up like a small bag. I just skip that part and don't t use any filter ( my old one didn't need one) and I do get a small amount of grounds in the bottom of the pot but not so much as to offset the pain of fiddling with the dumbest filter setup.

Good Ol' Cuppa Coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I'd been using a single-cup drip coffeemaker, and it worked fine, for what it was. But I was bugged by the fact that it was made almost entirely of plastic. Now, I don't want to suggest that all plastic coffeemakers are hazardous; in fact, I sincerely hope they're not. Practically all the popular drip-style brands have a lot of plastic in their construction, including the water reservoir where the water's boiled. I hate to think that millions of coffee drinkers are at hazard from drinking coffee brewed in these things...but the thought was enough for me to look for something in stainless steel. Frankly, I don't know if all of this Presto Coffee Maker is made of stainless steel (for instance, the base into which the perk tube is seated is certainly made of metal, but I don't know if it's steel or aluminum...hopefully steel, because other health problems are associated with aluminum cookware). Someday I might find the answer to that mystery; but, for now, I'm more than satisfied with having found a unit that gives me great-tasting coffee brewed with water that isn't boiled in plastic. And it does brew a nice cup. Brewing time isn't noticeably longer than in my old drip machine, and it has the added bonus of keeping the remaining coffee piping hot. Another nice feature is that I no longer have to be concerned that tardy drops of coffee will come plopping down, as sometimes happens after one removes the receptacle (glass urn or single cup) that receives the coffee from a drip-style machine. With this percolator, the brewing mechanism and the urn are one unit. Yay.

I recommend getting some basket-style paper coffee filters (the ones that look like giant muffin cups) to keep the grounds from embedding in the tiny holes in the bottom of the steel basket. I got 100 for less than two bucks in a nearby discount store, and I just punch a small hole in the middle, through which I can slide the perk tube. Works like a charm and makes cleaning a cinch: just dump the filter full of soggy grounds in the trash and rinse out the coffeemaker components in the sink (do NOT submerge the unit or terrible things will happen).

As you can see in the photos, it's a classic old-style coffee pot that one can fairly call elegant in its design. It's well-made, beautiful, and makes perfect coffee. And it's not very expensive. What more do you want? (As for that...person...who complained in his/her review about repeatedly breaking the cord...I hope it suffices to point out that the cord on this unit is a standard piece of equipment that you've probably seen on a dozen appliances in your lifetime and which is perfectly serviceable and durable if handled with the level of care one might expect to find in an 8-year-old of average intelligence.) You want a good old-fashioned coffeemaker that you'll like...even love? I don't think you can go wrong with this one.",MisterE,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de diciembre de 2013
Refined Excellence!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I have used several different brands of percs. I like this one the best. My experience is that Presto studied the other brand and refined this one to work better. For example the small holes in the bottom of the basket work much better for seeping flavor, oils, etc into the coffee pot without any grains getting through. I only use coarse grindings. It brews a very hot cup of coffee. I hate my coffee luke warm. Clean up is much less messy with the Presto than the other brand. I have not used a filter as it seems to not allow all the flavor, oils, etc through into the coffee pot. I am ok and actually like my coffee to have all the benefits of the bean even if it means my coffee is a bit cloudy. This thing works very well thus far and am very please with it. I like the smaller 6 cup version but found it just a tad too small - Presto needs to offer more like an 8 cup and a 12 cup IMHO. Anyway, Amazon is great when buying from them. I did purchase the 4 year protection plan as I plan on keeping this for a long time. By the way, Presto makes a black perc that I do not like the looks of but understand it also works well. Hope this helps!",R,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de agosto de 2023
Old man hot.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This thing makes my coffee hotter than any other electric coffee maker that I’ve used. I got so sick of the drip style coffee makers that barely make the coffee hot to begin with, and then the coffee is luke warm after a few mins and I always ended up putting my coffee in a microwave. So, I decided to give this electric perc thing a try, and the coffee is piping hot, it’s crusty old man hot, the way I like it and demand it to be. And it stays old man hot too as long as it’s plugged in. Also it’s small and takes up way less counter space, not ugly like the drip ones so it’s way less of an eye sore in my kitchen. The coffee tastes really good, I don’t even bother with using filters and it’s fine, makes no difference. It takes about 10 mins to make 12 cups. One small extra step is I use filtered water in one of those little jugs with a filter on it to increase flavor quality and soften the water a little. I should have got one of these electric perc coffee makers a long time ago. I’ll never use a gigantic ugly Luke warm drip style coffee maker again. It’s this thing to the end. There’s no safety off timer, I like that also because I drink coffee all day and it just stays hot forever, but that could be a deal breaker for the paranoid type. If that’s you, I say just buy a little plug with a built in timer for it because it’s worth the good tasting, actually hot coffee.",Zac,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de abril de 2023
Love it!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","The wife and I are trying to get away from using plastic, after a lot of research, we decided to go with the Presto percolator. With the all stainless steel construction this fits the bill nicely. It's easy to use and makes a great cup of coffee, we've tried not using a filter and use a filter, for us, using a filter makes the perfect cup. Without the filter the coffee was a little bit cloudy, but with the filter it was nice and clear, well as clear as black coffee can be. Bottom line is that this percolator works wonderfully and makes a great cup of coffee, Enjoy!!",AndyP,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de febrero de 2024
Awesome coffee taste --better than drip brew,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I brewed dark roast coffee, my preference. Better taste than drip brew coffee from plastic container.
My advice dont fill all the way up to 12 cups, needs room to boil and rise. I brewed up 6 cups so far and coffee is awesome.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de abril de 2024
