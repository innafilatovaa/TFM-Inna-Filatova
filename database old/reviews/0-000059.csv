Perfection in a Bean to Cup Coffee machine!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Play Video
Perfection in a Bean to Cup Coffee machine! I am so overwhelmed at how fantastic this machine produces cafe or barrista level quality coffee at home. I purchased this machine over a year ago and felt I really needed a long term review before writing one and thought now was my time to write it,

My machine is the De'Longhi Dinamica Plus Perfetto ECAM370.85.SB.

I was a Nespresso original pod owner that eventually got the Nespresso Vertuo and like allot of owners the coffee is fantastic end to end, but when you get the Vertuo machine the costs go up quite allot so after 5 years with the original pods (and using all kinds of brands of pods) then using the Vertuo I decided to take the upgrade to a ""Bean to Cup"" machine and did allot of research before choosing this one.

My ultimate goal was saving money vs buying pods and the impact on pod machines. Secondly I wanted to make sure that I was making excellent coffee vs going to a cafe to get the same quality.

Overall this machine has beaten all my expectations! Yes, the machine was expensive to purchase outright but within less than a year I have recovered that money vs Nespresso Pods (both Original and Vertuo)! Yes, less than a year and Yes, I drink allot of coffees!

From making Espresso's. Dopios, Cappuccino's, Latte's, Americano's tall coffees this machine does them all and fantastically! The best item you can change the beans to what you want to suit your tastes or how you like your coffee.

Cost: Yep, cost is upfront expensive but this in my opinion is negated vs buying pods.

Ease of Use: EASY PEASY. This machine makes 13 drinks right on the control panel and you can also create up to 5 unique tailored drinks that you customize to how it bests makes coffee drinks for you!

Coffee Drinks: Exceptional, fantastic, wonderful each and every time. I have not had 1 ""OK"" drink! Just great regardless of the one chosen. There is also a ground coffee port on the top that you can use to change the grounds being used to something new or let us say to Decaf coffee if the bean hopper is filled with regular beans. (if you use ground coffee you must select the ground coffee mode on the control panel!!!))

Ease of Cleaning: EASY. Delonghi Recommends a full cleaning 1 a month of this type of machine and the instruction booklet shows you how and their are ALLOT of videos on how todo this. It takes me about 20 minutes todo a thorough cleaning of the machine top to bottom. (wiping and drying the machine, cleaning out the water tray basket/grounds basket/water tank and the brewing unit). I typically rinse the tray basket/coffee basket every few days. The machine will tell you when the water tray/grounds are too full right on the screen and to empty them. Again simple.

Descaling: This can depend on the water hardness of your region and is settable in the machine. Using a filter will help but to be honest the time frame is based on how hard the setting of the machine is set to and how many coffees are made. Descaling alert shows up and takes about 40 minutes to complete. You can escape out of the alert but it will show up every time until a descale is completed.

Cons: I wish the cup/mug size was a little larger to allow taller glasses to be put under the spout (like a tall Latte glass) but that is my only negative on the machine. So be wary when buying latte glasses to use with this machine. Max that would work about 135mm in height or 5 1/4 inches.

I have the application to use the machine on my but rarely use it. It is nice but not necessary but I use this to configure My type of drinks to how I want and once saved will appear on the control panel.

Overall conclusion: Coffee Drink Perfection in a cup!

Easy to use, on screen instructions tell you when you need to empty coffee grounds container.

It stores an ample supply of coffee beans in a darkened container

customisation is easy, as settings as chosen during drink making process, so no guessing volumes.

Milk frother is easy to use, easy to clean , but i recommend grabbing the milk cleaning solution available as well. It definately helps with taste after a month or so.

Came with descaler solution and a water filter (good for around 2 months) included.",Wulf,Revisado en Reino Unido el 28 de febrero de 2022
Fantastic,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Absolutely love it!!
It took a little while to set up but we got the app and it's easier to do all the settings from that.
I like a cafelatte, at first I thought hmmm it's not very hot üò≥ But with the app settings we were able to customise everything easily.
The coffee quality is better than any coffee shop.
I used Starbucks Blonde coffee beans and Alpro soya milk.
I love how the machine is 1 touch when you've set your personal drink profile.

Does everything you want in a super automatic,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Previously I owed a barista express and had zero problems with that machine. My circumstances changed where I didn‚Äôt have 15 mins to make a coffee in the morning so I wanted something that does all the jobs for you.
This delonghi machine makes really good, consistent coffee and it‚Äôs saved me a lot of time in the morning. Cleaning is a lot easier, the pucks come out nice and easily. The only issues I have is that the taste is compromised and the coffee is not boiling hot. I was aware of this before I purchased it so it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much. I know that all super automatic machines will have these problems, regardless of the price.
The app is crap btw but I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be amazing in the first place. You have to have your coffee machine on, and connect it to the app everytime you wanna use it. Don‚Äôt get this machine if you wanna use the app on the daily. It‚Äôs a nice gimmic to have if you have guests over.
If your mornings are hectic and you want good quality coffee then go for this machine.",Mo,Revisado en Reino Unido el 29 de diciembre de 2021

"Terrible machine, even worse customer service.","1,0 de 5 estrellas","Quite a complicated process to simply have a coffee. First week was fine then coffee started getting hotter and hotter. Temperature adjustment was faulty and the machine was almost boiling the water and burning the coffee. Awful taste and despite cleaning everything it had to be returned.
De‚ÄôLonghi customer support is shockingly poor. We bought this machine to enjoy over the Xmas break. They now want to pick it up to inspect it. I now have to take a day off work to wait in between 9-6pm. It is going take upto 28 days to inspect!! They refuse to replace it.

Don‚Äôt bother!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I have had one of these machines before and found it excellent and it lasted a long time. We decided to buy another one bean to cup however this machine has been nothing but trouble from the beginning we got it it does not blend correctly I think the knob is on back to front so you don‚Äôt get the strength of coffee you want so end up drinking coffee that looks like tea. I have arranged for it to be collected I contacted them on Monday and was expecting somebody on Tuesday as I was due to go to work on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday unfortunately it‚Äôs now Friday and nobody has come to collect this machine, I am really not happy about this as I cannot get hold of anybody to discuss it with so I‚Äôm just stuck waiting for somebody to collect this stupid machine that I don‚Äôt want any more because it‚Äôs rubbish.

So why wouldn't we have the best machine we can afford. To be honest we were perfectly happy with our wee pod machine...then we saw the De'longhi advert with gorgeous Brad Pitt!!
He made this all singing all dancing coffee machine look super easy to use!! And it is..!
I've had my fair share of espresso machines over the years and have managed to break or fall out with every one.
However, this... This De'longhi dynamica plus is idiot proof!
You simply can't go wrong.

I am yet to master the coffee App.... yes, there's an App for that!
But I'm 50.. give me a break.

"Quieter, hotter, bigger serving and faster than my trusty 6 year old Delongi Authentica","4,0 de 5 estrellas","On Saturday after 6 years trusty De‚ÄôLongi Authentica gave up the ghost, today the new Dynamic turned up today. If you‚Äôve used the brand before set up is similar and intuitive. After a few trials and adjustments I was making the various coffees and setting up ‚ÄúMy‚Äù preferences coffee through the app. It‚Äôs certainly easy to use and although my staple drink for mornings is a long with shot of cold milk, it is nice to be able to create all the varieties for guests should they want anything more fancy.

My old machine made coffee you had to drink very quickly as the temperature was not great, I found my Dinamica easy to program hotter and have a coffee then I can return to after a quick shower and still drink hot, also this model makes four sizes and the biggest is 220ml which fills a medium cup. You can add more hot water instantly for a larger Americano from the separate spout.

There are a few things I don‚Äôt like too much, my last machine was a solid weighty stainless steel and this is quality but not to the same degree, it does look good but I don‚Äôt know if those looks will last. The app started working perfectly and I tried from all over the house, but then it got a bit strange once the machine went into standby. I wanted to wake up, prepare a long black from bed and walk down and pick up my coffee. It seemed like it would at first but it powers off after an hour or so and I don‚Äôt seem to consistently be able to turn the machine on again through Bluetooth. So it looks like I have to go downstairs to switch it on again prep the machine first. It‚Äôs a cool gadget though to go take everyone‚Äôs different coffees orders and give options of size, strength and heat. Other great thing is descaling has a one touch button in settings, I used to have to get the manual out each time for the Authentic which still confuses me after 6 years.

Overall, it‚Äôs some improvement on my requirements but it‚Äôs also fairly expensive. 90% of the time it will be pumping out the same cup of long black coffee but the odd cappuccino is nice for guests and it exercises the milk drinks very well. The best thing for me though is the temperature and and the memorised customisation. No real problems quite yet but it‚Äôs only day one. It‚Äôs a fun gadget for now.",Paul_Bristol,Revisado en Reino Unido el 17 de agosto de 2021

Not very good at all.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Let me begin and say my previous machine lasted 7 years at least. So I am looking at this from improvement point of view. This new machine is not as good as the old one. Which for example we only descaled once a month. This machine needs descaling every week. The largest cup of coffee in the custom coffee recipe you can make 180ml... So not a mug. Very disappointing.
The mobile app doesn't work. And it's like the software is not for this machine. Help files are not available through the software either. There is also no proper help for all the functions. The custom or my recipes are very limited in what you can create. the amounts are the issue.
The water filter needs replacing after 2 weeks. despite setting a 2 month period on the dial. Probably better to remove it. But then you will need to descal every third day.
For the price this machine is under developed. And I expected so much more. I would have been better off with a unit of half the price.",Chadley,Revisado en Reino Unido el 25 de noviembre de 2020

By searching on description, ie 'Dinamica Plus', you will probably find yourself at the version ECAM370.95 and there is a world of difference. Yes you can customise the strength and size of drinks BUT ONLY FOR EVERYONE AND/OR JUST ONE OTHER (Me/My drinks) - multiple individual customisations (Profiles) it has not.
