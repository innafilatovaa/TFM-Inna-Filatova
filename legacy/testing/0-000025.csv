"Delicious, Easy, and Consistent","5,0 de 5 estrellas","We love our new percolator. It makes consistent delicious coffee. It can also sit for hours and stay hot and tasty, unlike a drip machine coffee that tastes off after sitting for too long. It is super easy to prepare, put together, and clean. Demos say to use a paper filter special for a percolator, but we just cut a hole in a paper basket filter from our old drip machine. It takes a try or two to get the measurements right when you are making different amounts of coffee, but i just keep a post-it note in my cupboard for the amounts we like now. More coffee scoops are needed than for a drip machine, but it is worth it for the great coffee. It can make from 2 cups (1 coffee mug) for single serving as well, for days when I'm drinking solo, but I usually make more because it is so tasty. So happy with this purchase!",Lorax,Revisado en Canadá el 20 de junio de 2021

Makes a great cup of hot coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I’ve run the gamut on all sorts of coffee makers and know how to make a good cup of coffee. Pour over using a kettle and kalita wave, v60, or Chemex will get you the most nuanced coffee as long as you know how to pour it. It takes practice and I used to have the time and patience for it, but now I reserve those moments for when I’m truly in the mood. There are good drip brewers out there that make good coffee and I recommend using, especially the ones that brew at the right temps and speed, and I never thought old fashioned percolators can make good coffee. I always thought they “burn” coffee and brewing with recirculated coffee ruins the taste. I was wrong. I recently learned through experience that Percs and can make great coffee. I purchased this coffee maker mostly out of curiosity. I wanted my coffee to stay hotter in my mug for longer, and drip coffee just seemed to cool down too fast, even from the SCAA recommended machines. Preheating the mug is a workaround, but requires an extra step that you really don’t want in the morning. Knowing that percs are known for making hotter coffee, I purchased this one. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. This thing makes great tasting, hot coffee. There is a learning curve though. Here is what works for me:
I put a scoop of ice in the pot along with my water to make it very cold before brewing. These electric percs need very cold water to start to get the best results.
Do not use a filter. I tried using the sample filters that came with the pot but the few times I tried I got very weak coffee. I think these filters allow water to bypass the coffee grounds in the basket, and don’t allow the full and even saturation needed. The benefit you get of easier clean up is not worth getting a horrible tasteless pot of coffee.
Use freshly ground beans. If the beans are freshly roasted, even better. But at a minimum, to get the best tasting coffee from any brew method the beans need to be ground right before brewing. Burr grinders give the best results. However if you don’t have a grinder that’s ok. I buy pre-ground coffee too. I make sure to buy only small containers so the grounds don’t get too stale before they are used.
Grind the beans to a coarseness level slightly above drip. However, regular drip grind works just fine.
Experiment with coffee to water ratios to get the results you want. In this perc I prefer a 20:1 ratio (20 parts of water to 1 part of coffee grounds, by weight).
Unplug the perc shortly after brewing. Doing this will preserve the best flavors of the coffee.
Lastly, after it’s cooled, if there is still unused coffee that you want drink, you can “freshen” it up easily. First take out the basket and tube. Put the lid back on and plug it in again. The pot will start heating the coffee. In about 2 min the light will go on and the coffee will be at the same hot temp again. Unplug the pot and enjoy your cup. (Won’t be a good as first cup but close enough for me).

Using these guidelines for myself, I always get a delicious, full bodied, piping hot coffee that is better than any cheap drip machine, just as good as high quality drip machines, and the coffee stays hot in my mug longer. I was surprised that these vintage style percs made good coffee, but I guess they knew what they were doing 50+ years ago when these were popular. The convenience of drip took over, but I’ve found that percs have a certain charm to them. While not as “convenient” its still very easy to use. I enjoy the sounds it makes, and I like that they are so simple to clean. It’s all metal, no plastic, which also means hot water is not touching any plastic during brewing, which you can’t say for most drip machines. Plus it has a small blueprint so takes up a lot less space. The only thing I wish it had was auto-shut-off. The only way to turn it off is pulling the plug out of the pot. Auto-shut off after 1-2 hours should be a standard feature. I can’t see how leaving the pot on all day would be desirable at all.
Overall I really like this pot. It’s nostalgic and makes great coffee!",RMG,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de diciembre de 2023

This is the best percolator I've ever owned,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I've just been through 2 Cuisinart PRC-12NC units over the past 4 years. They started making weak coffee after about one year. So, I decided to switch brands to the Presto. Wow, what a difference!

This Presto unit is really built sturdy. On the Cuisinarts the clear plastic bulb/handle on top broke off easily, but on the Presto it's a hard plastic, solid-grip handle that is held in place by a very secure connection on the underside of the lid. This means that the lid is tighter, keeping the heat in better, and it pulls off easily, with a small, but not significant, tug.

Because of the design of the basket/basket cover, the brew is much stronger, requiring less coffee to make a very flavorful cup. I do not, however, use the included paper filters. No need. Very few grinds get through, and I always add a touch more water so that I don't pour them out anyway.

All in all, a really great buy.",Jeff Knight,Revisado en Canadá el 29 de febrero de 2024
"If Your Looking For A Coffee Percolator That Makes Excellent Tasting Coffee, This Is It!","5,0 de 5 estrellas","In the first years of my life, I grew up with a coffee percolator. Its in my humble opinion, a percolator is the best way to make coffee. Back in the 1990's, companies started marketing drip style coffee makers. They would classically show somebody getting coffee grounds all over their percolators, and using that as a reason to switch to drip. Well, it must have worked, because our family switched to drip style coffee makers, and we went through many of them, as they never lasted more then 3 to 5-years!

I gotta be honest, when you've tasted drip brewed coffee, it just isn't as good. When you've tasted percolator brewed coffee, its like a night and day difference. After a power outage spike took out our old coffee maker, it was time to finally go back to the percolator, and we chose the Presto. How does it measure up? Well, let me install a new surge protector first, plug the percolator into it, and then I'll tell ya.

The coffee maker comes packaged fairly well, nice box, cardboard separation inserts. Comes with an included 2-prong power cord, the same kind waffle irons, rice makers, and crock pots use. It comes with a instruction manual, and all the parts that make up the percolator, all packaged in plastic bags, which you must take out, and install properly to get ready for use.

With the lid removed, filter basket and tube, fill the unit with the amount of water you require for the needed cups you want. For example, if you want to make 12-cups of coffee, fill to the 12-cup mark. I grind my own coffee beans with a portable B&D electric coffee grinder. I like my coffee strong, so I fill the grinder to its max level, and I just do a medium grind, that way you don't get a lot of grounds getting past the filter basket into your coffee.

Yes, I am well aware of the age old discussion, to paper filter, or not paper filter, that is the question. To be perfectly honest, using paper filters will indeed alter the taste of the coffee to be less desirable, all to have no grounds at the bottom of the pot. If you do a medium grind, you won't get that many grounds at the bottom of the pot anyway, so I recommend to not use a paper filter for best flavor results.

Once you have filed the filter basket, just place the percolator pickup tube into it, then center the bottom half of the tube, with the bowl shaped recessed notch at the bottom of the coffee pot. Then just hold it in place while you install the lid. The lid literally snaps into place, so there is no way that lid is ever coming off on its own, without human intervention, so you can trust it, which is a plus. Then all you have to do is plug the cord into the wall, and the coffee maker begins percolating after just a few seconds.

When the coffee pot is fully filled, it is surprisingly heavy, so much so, I decided to weigh it. The coffee maker weighs in 6-pounds and 10.7-ounces, that is almost 7-pounds! It is in my opinion, that seniors who are suffering from arthritis, will have quite a bit of difficulty managing this coffee pot. I remember my mother had a lot of trouble, just trying to lift a 12-cup drip style pot. So you might want to use a second hand with a pot holder, to help you support the pot as you pore.

The good news however, is that this pot has an excellent handle, that remains cool to the touch, so you never have to worry about getting burned, as what would happen with a stove top percolator! Additionally, the percolator has a beautiful spout, and it functions as good as it looks, pores beautifully. I recommend that you use filtered water, I use a Britta filter, which is better for your health, and helps to reduce calcium deposits in the coffee pot.

The company claims that the percolator takes 1-minute per cup, so 12-cups = 12-minutes. I am always wary of company claims when it comes to marketing, so I decided to test that. The water sat long enough in the pot to reach room temperature before I plugged it in. As my video clearly shows, the Presto 12-cup percolator took a total of 12-minutes and 55-seconds to finish brewing. So while that is nearly a whole minute longer then company claims, its well within the norm, so they get a pass.....This time.

By now your wondering, all this is well and good, but how does the coffee taste? I am happy to report, that the coffee that this percolator makes, tastes phenomenal! Literally, every time I took a sip, I was in heaven. Its like one of those things that makes you ask yourself, ""what have I been doing with all of my life?"" The answer is, you've been doing it wrong for years, but now you own a percolator, so you've redeemed yourself. I can't recommend the flavor that this machine produces enough!

Please note that, unlike drip style coffee makers that never get the coffee that hot, this percolator makes coffee piping hot, 195-degrees Fahrenheit. Be careful with your first sips, unless you cool it down a bit with some liquid creamer or milk.

Now as far as cleanup is concerned, its not the huge ordeal that companies made it out to be, when they suggested that you switch to drip style coffee makers. Simply, remove the lid, run it under hot water, set aside. Remove the filter basket, knock it against the inside of your trash can, most of the grounds fall in, or use a piece of paper towel to assist. Run the filter basket under hot water to rinse out any remaining grounds. Run some water through the pickup tube, just make sure its clear, set aside to dry.

A quick rinse of the pot as well, not even soap is required, Its literally that simple, and now your percolator will be ready for the next pot you make. I recommend only plugging and unplugging the cord from the male end that goes into the wall, there is really no need to detach it from the coffee maker itself. But when the coffee percolator finishes brewing, it will automatically turn off and switch to warming mode. I don't recommend leaving the pot in warming mode for longer then 30-minutes though, that way the coffee stays fresh and doesn't turn bitter on ya.

I would have preferred that this coffee maker had an on/off switch, but that doesn't appear to be a feature, that is found on percolators in general, not just from this brand. Other then that, I literally have nothing else negative to say about it. The percolator is both beautiful in design, as it is, in its function to make excellent tasting coffee, what more could you want? I really love this coffee maker and I can't recommend it enough. If you've been using a drip style coffee maker, please do yourself a favor, and get a percolator.

I rate this coffee maker a solid 5 out of 5 stars! Highly recommended!",Arthur Senior,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de noviembre de 2020
Muy bien,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Buen producto, funcionable y calidad en sus materiales y además un café con buen sabor y temperatura",SALVADOR G.,Revisado en México el 16 de febrero de 2024
All around fantastic coffee maker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","We have tried several coffeemakers since starting our family (it takes a lot of coffee to fuel our two-working-parents-with-a-new-house-and-two-children-under-two household) and this, my friends, is THE BEST. To understand my rating you may need to know what we were looking for to begin with, and how this machine satisfied our criteria.

What we wanted
1) First, we needed hot coffee and fast!
2) Coffee must taste good
3) NO plastic - at least where the nearly boiling hot water comes into contact with it
4) Ease of use - KISS rule applies here, as we're operating on very little sleep these days

How it performed

1) This pot knocks this out of the park. It only takes about 6-8 minutes to brew 6 cups. It is HOT and it stays hot for a long time (actually, it will stay hot as long as you have the machine plugged into the outlet, which is a really nice feature when we're home on the weekends). A couple of our other machines actually took longer to brew coffee as we encountered filter problems and other issues. Side note - we keep a huge Brita filter of water in our fridge, and use it for coffee so we don't need all the extra filtering of other machines.

2) The taste of coffee will be affected by many factors, not the least of which is the quality of your selected beans, the roast, how freshly ground it is, and using COLD water to begin, however even with the best coffees our previous coffee makers left something to be desired. This machine consistently makes delicious coffee. Seriously, it is such a pleasure to drink.

3) This one is really important. As we increased the amount of coffee we drink, we realized that pretty much all other machines involve plastic parts somewhere in the brew process, despite having metal baskets and the like. That means there is a pretty good chance some unhealthful substances could be leaching into the water, and into the coffee. We use steel and glass with our other beverages and for our children's drinks - but had ignored the almost 16 oz of coffee a day we were consuming! This entire machine, with the exception of the base and handle, is steel. All that boiling hot water comes in contact with is metal. I suspect that also has something to do with how well it performs on the flavor scale.

4) Again, home run. This machine isn't any more labor intensive to use than a Mr. Coffee or a Cuisinart. In fact, it might be simpler since you don't have to pour water from a carafe into some silly little hole somewhere on the machine, risking spilling water all over the counter. Fill the carafe with cold water. Fill the basket with grounds. Insert bar, basket, and lids. Plug it in. Pour your cereal, hug your kids, pack your lunch, whatever you fancy. 8 minutes later you're pouring a delicious, hot mug of joe. We have a grinder and only buy whole bean coffee. Sometimes we grind the coffee the night before to save time, but plenty of mornings we have grind it just before making the coffee. Still a simple and quick process..even when we are exhausted.

Additionally, you can make small amounts of coffee without needing a special setting. The coffee isn't any weaker as a result, unlike other machines. I think this has to do with how hot this machine gets the water prior to brewing. It isn't heating up along the way, like some other machines. So the first few cups are just as good as the rest. You can, however, make a big full pot, which is nice for us because our parents come to visit often and all drink coffee too. And the whole big pot is piping hot. That brings me to a negative aspect of this machine. If you brew a pot, and want another, you have to wait until the pot cools. I've been raving about how hot it makes coffee, and that it's made of metal. Well, it becomes a dangerously hot piece of metal. Clean up is easy with this machine too. We compost our grounds so it is as simple as dumping the basket into our compost container, and rinsing out the parts. Something to be mindful of, though, is ensuring that you UNPLUG the machine before you leave. Best case scenario, you return to hot coffee in the evening, if that's your thing, but I'm afraid of causing an electrical fire so our post-coffee routine is simply unplugging it before leaving for work. Again, it is usually too hot to clean right away so we do this in the evening.

You'll notice some features we weren't looking for, and which this product does not have:

1) Brew interrupt for pouring a cup while it is still brewing. We aren't that impatient. We have plenty to do while we wait for the full pot to brew. But some folks may not like that.

2) Clock - we have that on our stove...and our phones...and our toaster oven...and our wall. We're good with clocks

3) Programmable brewing - again, not necessary for us as we find using this machine to be quick and easy. We did enjoy this feature on other products (waking up to coffee brewing for you is so nice!) but the trade off for no plastic parts was worth it to us. Plus, my husband is so sweet about getting up first and making the coffee, so not much has changed for me in this way ;-)

Well, this is the longest review I have ever written, but I know how people are about their coffee...because I am one of those people. I hope this review helps. We've had this machine for 6 months, it's going strong, it looks cool on the counter, it's easy to use and it makes one darn good cup of coffee.",PetiteCharette,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de junio de 2014
"An okay percolator, but majorly inconsistent with coffee strength and too hot to use around kids","1,0 de 5 estrellas","After moving to a new house with limited counter space, my old larger premium coffee maker started to malfunction. So I decided to replace it with something smaller - this percolator - which takes up much less counter space and is highly rated.

Sadly to say, I'm disappointed in the purchase and will be looking for a replacement.

Two major issues:
1. I never know if the coffee it makes will be weak or tasty. I like my coffee strong..all the time. But with this one, I can use literally the same amount of coffee, ground precisely the same, with the same amount of water, tamped down as they recommend (all instructions followed to the letter)...and it may or may not be drinkable. Yesterday for example, it came out looking like tainted water and NOT coffee. This has happened 3-4 times since I bought it in early 2023. Other days, it might be strong, might be okay, or might be really weak. It's a daily guess as to what I should expect. I HATE weak coffee, so if you're like me, buy something else.
2. It get extremely hot on the exterior while plugged in. My son didn't realize it was on the other day and he pushed it back to use the counter, and we had to treat a minor burn on his hand. Of course, if you are in a household where kids are not around, that's not nearly as big of a big deal. If you have littles, get something safer or put it where they can't reach at all. I recommend the manufacturer consider a more obvious location for the ""on"" light"" or add one on both sides because it is easy to overlook in full daylight.

UPDATE: It got worse over time and now makes bad coffee almost every pot. I'd avoid this one and buy another type of coffee maker if you don't like weak, acidic coffee.",Tommy Landry,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de mayo de 2023
Extremely Disapointed- Buyer Beware...Seriously Don't Make the Same Mistake I Did.,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Ok so I purchased this pot back in October 2012 to replace a Farberware that had kicked the bucket. The pot arrived and worked as advertised in fact it worked so well that I was actually contemplating buying three more as gifts for friends until Thanksgiving day hit. Our percolator gets used two days out of the week and is only turned on for approximately 2 hours in the morning each of those two days. On Thanksgiving we brewed two pots of coffee for the family and it was only on long enough to brew those two pots. The next morning when I decided to brew a pot I noticed that it wasn't making its usual robust ""pop"" noise and just moved on until I poured my first cup. The coffee was luke warm and near tasteless. Thinking that it must have been a fluke I just went about my day and turned the pot off, dumped the pot out and rinsed it out as usual. Fast forward to Christmas and we used it back to back again on Christmas morning this time we brewed 4 pots instead of 2. By pot #3 it was weak and cold, pot #4 never brewed. I was pissed...really pissed. I take care of my stuff and this coffee pot was basically new having only been used on a handful of weekends. From then on I have had hit or miss pots of coffee with increasing frequency of a bad pot until this past weekend ...the pot is completely dead. When you put water in the pot and plug it in the light turns red after about 5 minutes to indicate that the coffee is ready...except that no brewing has occurred.

What else am I supposed to do here? Take a loss of 50 bucks and move on or pay to ship it back, and pay the restocking fee which in the end will only yield me about 35 bucks of money returned if even that?

This pot works great at the onset but peters out quickly there after. I read the reviews prior to buying and knew it was risk, amazon obviously knows it is a piece of junk because of the return policy that it retains, and most everyone else noted that their experience was similar.

Coffee Maker Has Gone Downhill,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","The first one of these coffeemakers was given to me by my mother in law 8 or 9 years ago and it was an amazing percolator. You could hear it perking from anywhere in the house. It make HOT coffee that was nice and strong or not, depending on how much grounds you used, perked 12 cups in around 15 minutes...it was awesome until one morning, it just stopped working and that was it. Less than two years ago, I replaced it with the exact same model, but it just wasn't quite the same. Didn't really make a noise when it perked, took longer to perk, coffee still tasted good, but wasn't as hot. Almost two years to the day of my purchase, it died!

Well, I thought I'd take a chance and replace it with the same so once more, I ordered another and got it last month. It came, I filled it with plain water to clean it, it perked really hard, got really hot, perked quickly, I thought ""Oh boy! We're back in business!!"" WRONG! The minute I put grounds in the basket, the same thing happens. No perking, no sound of perking, weak coffee, and it takes half an hour for the red light to indicate it's done. Today, after half an hour, the red light came on, then went off, then it actually did start perking. Don't buy this pot. They've ruined the design somehow and it's gone downhill. Not worth the money anymore. I'm on a well with a water softener and don't want a pot with an internal pump. I want something where I can clean all the parts, but this pot is not it. I can't tell you how disappointed I am that a once perfect pot is no more.",nightsmusic,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de febrero de 2023
Really nice Percolator - Until it stopped working,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","Loved this percolator - makes great coffee, quick to perk, perfect cup size for me. Was loving this perker until one day - almost a year to the day I bought it - it stopped working. I faithfully cleaned the perker well every week and never got the pot base wet. But one day it just quit working. I jiggled the cord and it began to perk. This worked okay for a couple days then nothing. I'm ordering a new cord but I'm not optimistic. Very disappointed and can not recommend due to quality of manufacture.
This is an update 2 weeks after I wrote this review. I upped the rating from 1 to 2. I had to order a replacement power cord for a total of $18.65 with shipping and now it works again. I really like the coffee pot but the cord shouldn't have failed after a year and it shouldn't have been this expensive to replace it. But at least it's working for now.
This is an update from several months later. The pot completely quit working. Plugged it in one morning, the orange light immediately came on but it wouldn't perk. Between the cost of the pot and cable, this is a HUGE rip off. What a piece of garbage and I would not buy.

Cheap and flimsy,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this to replace a Cuisinart percolator with a heating element that went bad. Upon unwrapping, I noticed small chips in the plastic of the pot and lid handles. The Presto pot is lightweight and flimsy, much less substantial than the Cuisinart was, and the stainless steel is very thin. The powercord is also very thin and light and only a 2-prong instead of a 3.

The first few times I used this pot, the coffee was terrible and full of grounds. I finally realized the basket lid is so thin and light that the force of the perking coffee was lifting it, allowing the grounds to escape into the coffee. Luckily my husband had not yet disposed of our old percolator. He replaced the basket, stem, and basket lid that came with this pot with the old ones from the Cuisinart pot and it worked. The basket lid was slightly heavier- enough to keep it down during perking and the coffee is now fine and free of grounds. The old basket is more convenient, too, because the Presto basket does not have fill levels marked on it, making measuring necessary, but the Cuisinart basket does.

Another issue is that it takes a really long time to make a pot of coffee. About 20 minutes for 10-12 cups, and only a couple of minutes less for 8 cups.

The reason I did not buy another Cuisinart is that I was unhappy with the one I had only lasting a little over a year before the heating element burned out. I only make coffee at home once or twice a week, but when I do, I leave it plugged in for 3-4 hours so I can grab a hot cup while I'm working. My percolators do not get what I consider to be heavy use and I thought it should have lasted longer than it did. But the next time the coffee pot goes, I will probably go back to Cuisinart. I'm very unhappy with the cheap quality of the Presto. I bought it because I was under the impression that because the company was in the United States it would not be a cheap piece of junk made in China, like so many of the other percolator reviews indicated. However, on the bottom of the pot, right under where it says ""National Presto Ind., Inc., Eau Claire, WI"", it also says ""Made In China."" I wasn't happy with the lifespan of the Cuisinart but I'd be shocked to get that long out of this pot. I definitely do not recommend the Presto, unless you have a way to keep the basket lid down so you don't have to drink sludge.",Sister Renee Pittelli,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de marzo de 2010
Inconsistent,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This is the third percolator I have had and the first one to be very inconsistent in brewing good, rich coffee. Turns out week most of the time. Last two I had made great coffee right up until they stopped working altogether. Going to give up on this one after little over a year and toss it. Presto reviews were good but maybe this one is a dud. I won't try another Presto.",Michael Jorgensen,Revisado en Canadá el 13 de abril de 2024
UPDATE: THREE YEARS IN (and down to one star),"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This will be almost three years we've had this pot and by now I'm ready to toss it. It used to make a pretty decent cup of coffee. Now it's beyond horrid. I know it wasn't an expensive pot (it was $30 when I bought it) but I'll be a nutter if I'm going to spend $50 on a new one that most likely won't last any longer. I love coffee out of a percolator but the experiences I've had (this is two different pots from different companies have done the same thing) has me going back to a drip system.

BOO Presto! BOO!

I've had this pot for going on two years now

Pros:
- It makes a pretty good cup of coffee.
- It can usually go three or four pots before it gets dirty enough to need a good cleaning (spout & stem)

Cons:
- a 12-cup pot SHOULD hold 12 measured liquid cups, as in 96 ounces because that is 12 liquid cups!. To start with, it only holds 8 measured liquid cups (used my old Pyrex four-cup measurer for this). The grounds soak up their share and the air gets a fair bit of moisture through evaporation. If everyone around here carefully measures their coffee there's enough brew to fill seven-and-a-half cups. If not, someone invariably gets shorted an entire cup.

- Someone here says ""don't scrub the inside"". Oh, that is so wrong! In the bottom is the heating thing and it's not stainless steel and it WILL corrode in very short order and when it does the coffee tastes horrid. Inside the spout and stem will also build up residue eventually that will ruin the flavor of your coffee.

Other thoughts: When it comes to cleaning we occasionally like to percolate a pot of fresh water with a little mild dish detergent (you don't want to use vinegar because that metal heating thing in the bottom that isn't stainless) in it (still have to hand-clean the spout and stem, though) but afterward we could still taste soap so I gave Seventh Generation Dish Liquid, Free & Clear, 25 oz and there's no soapy flavor afterward.",Periwinkle,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de febrero de 2018
Review Update,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","For the longest time I've been using a drip coffee maker and one of the better ones at that and I've been saying for years that I miss the old electric percolators and I finally bought a Presto and I'm so glad I did. It's been a very long time since I've enjoyed a morning cup of French roast as good as this and I'll never go back to drip. The Presto is very well made in every way. There really is no point in having a glass top on the Presto because you have no direct control over the perk time anyway because the Presto isn't a stove top design. We grind our own beans to a finer grind probably than most folks do and to avoid spilling the ground coffee down the spout in the basket we simply drop a 1/2"" stainless 10-32 screw into the spout before pouring in the fresh grounds. Just don't forget to remove the screw before placing the lid on the pot. Also, not much grounds ends up in the bottom of the pot and I think it is because the lid that installs over the basket encourages more water to flow through the grounds because of the lids design. The cone shaped drip coffee maker with a paper filter allows too much water to bypass the coffee grounds which results in a weak cup of coffee and simply adding more grounds does not rectify the problem because more water then bypasses the grounds. For me it's the Presto percolator forever and I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. Many thanks to Presto and Amazon.

I must unfortunately amend this review. After experimenting further with this product we've decided to stay with our Cuisinart 12 cup drip coffee maker because it takes far less coffee grounds to make the same amount of finished product and even after using much more grounds to make the same amount of coffee the taste and quality still isn't near as good tasting as that produced by our drip machine. Also, cleanup must be performed after each pot of coffee which isn't easy and takes a lot of hot water time and paper towels. We're very disappointed with this percolator.",James Wilkinson,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de enero de 2024
Foul / odd smell emitting from steam at spout and same smell from suface of hot cups of coffee,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I didn't think it was fair to give this product a poor review without a detailed explanation because we have faithfully purchasing the Presto 12 cup percolator since November of 2015. Searching MY ORDERS on my Prime account we have purchased a total of 6 of these units. We go through A LOT of coffee here at our house. 6 to 8 pounds of ground coffee monthly. 3 to 5 pots a day.........6 to 12 cup brews depending upon how many we are at the time. During the Covid period I picked up two of these to have a new backups in case the supply chain was interrupted and we happened to have our working unit go down. (typically the cord connection at the unit will eventually emit a mild odor of warm plastic / wire. We've ordered a replacement cord and that worked great for another year until I got another whiff of that connection odor last week so i tossed that one out and broke out one of the two new units I had as spares. Like I usually do, I cleaned the interior of the unit and the basket parts by running a full 12 cups of filtered water through 2 cycles, then a full pot of coffee. All three batches caused a strange, metallic, odorous steam out of the spout and same very noticeable odor at the surface of the hot coffee. I figured it would go away eventually. After twos days and probably 6 pots of coffee the odor never went away. I decided to open the second new unit and ran them both with a solution of white vinegar and filtered water. After cooling I rinsed them both thoroughly and percolated 8 cups in each of pots, using the same Maxwellhouse Smooth Bold coffee grinds we use daily. Well the pot that was emitting the odor was still doing so, with no improvement whatsoever while the newest pot produced the same perfect coffee we've become accustomed to using these Presto 12 cup units. So we got one lemon out of 6 pots purchased since 2015. I'm writing this lengthy review in hopes that someone at Presto will want to have this unit returned to them so they can ""smell for themselves"" and hopefully figure out what is causing it for the purpose of not having someone else buy one of these and never buy another. For 20 years prior to 2015 we were loyal to the Fabreware 12 cup units which used to last forever. But the last couple of units we got stopped working from failure of the heating elements that we found out had become a common problem that went on for a while......so we tried Presto and we've stuck with them since then. So if you get one of these funny smelling steam emissions from your Presto spout and the hot coffee poured out of it......you'll know it's not your nose :-)",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de septiembre de 2022
Junky Presto Coffee Pot.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Not too much to like about it. It does not have a sight glass to see how much coffee is left in the pot. It does not have the see through percolator lid. The light does not change when it's done brewing. The basket holes are too small and the coffee grounds overflow into the coffee. The lid takes two hands, and is difficult to remove, especially when it is still hot. The handle is very poorly designed, the funky shape makes it unbalanced, and just to make it painful they put square edges on it. The whole thing looks and feels crappy. Finally but not least, the coffee flavor is not good, like it's not completely done.",STEPHEN A STERN,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de junio de 2024
Not worth the money,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this Presto percolator to replace a ten-year-old (ten!) Cuisinart perc that finally died. Shopped for another one but was a little concerned that there appear to be few new ones in stock but a lot of used ones available (is Cuisinart maybe phasing it out). Plus the Presto product was less expensive but appeared to be a close replacement. Big mistake. The grounds (whole beans ground specifically for percolator) escape from the basket and get into the water, the power cord doesn't have a three-prong grounded plug (suggesting a wimpy heating element unlikely to last long), and the lid is too tight a fit and hard to take off. Plus it came with a few weirdly folded paper filters that I'm sure aren't available at my grocery store. But why filters at all?! One of the benefits of a percolator is that you don't need a filter unless using finely-ground coffee in a pinch. I'll clean the Presto up and donate it to Goodwill while ordering another Cuisinart like I should have in the first place.",nrg,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de febrero de 2024
You have to use a filter,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","The whole purpose of getting a percolator coffee pot is to make fresh coffee without useing a filter. This perks so hard it pushes grounds out the top of the basket. They sent filters in the box with the pot. I am very disappointed with this product
I use a regular grind coffee grounds
I use a proper coffee scoop when measuring the grounds per cup. When making 12 cups the amount of ground in the coffee was worse. I do not make more than 10 cups at a time. I am going to buy a different brand and get rid of this one",James N.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de mayo de 2024

Saveur de café faible,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Après 4 semaines d'utilisation, je le retourne. J'ai essayé plusieurs sortes de mouture, mis plus de café pour un café riche mais lorsqu'on met 10g de café par tasse donc de mon côté 8 tasses/ 90g, une de plus pour un café goûteux, pour la famille le matin, le café passe par-dessus et se ramasse dans la cafetière. Je n'ai pas essayé de faire 12 tasses car le réservoir pour recevoir le café est trop petit et la tige centrale selon moi devrait être plus longue, c'est probablement pour cette raison que le café sort du réservoir et se retrouve dans la cafetière même si je met un filtre à disque à café dans le réceptacle. À mon avis ne pas faire plus de 8 tasses à la fois avec cette cafetière.
Par contre concernant la chaleur du café je mets un 5 étoiles.
De plus les éléments au fond ne semblent pas en acier inoxydable comme mentionné ce qui me laisse perplexe, il déteigne, change de couleur. J'ai acheté ce produit car le % de bons commentaires était plus nombreux que les négatifs mais au final, je suis déçue. Je ne lâche pas ma recherche pour me trouver un bon percolateur.
Les compagnies devraient mettre plus d'images de leurs produits que ce soit externe mais surtout l'intérieur, le matériau et les dimensions de toutes leurs composantes ainsi on ne ferait pas d'achat sans être au courant mais surtout éviter les retours qui au final se ramasse on ne sait où!!! Pas trop environnemental.

Loses Heat Over Time,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I did a lot of research and got a few different models while in search of HOT coffee. I ended up getting this and was pleased for about 6 months. Then gradually the coffee got less hot. Still great for the first cup but even after 20 minutes, the temperature dropped and I'd need to nuke it for 30 sec. In retrospect, this is consistent with what others have said about all percolators made today; the heating elements don't last. I just ordered a vintage coffeemaker from the 1970's, when things were built to last longer - hoping for a good hot cup that lasts.

Also, someone in a review originally suggested that since this coffee pot doesn't have automatic shutoff that one get a separate timer that plugs into the wall. This was great suggestion and worked well.

The bottom is rusting out :( Do NOT recommend.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Overall, this makes good coffee. I like that I'm not having to use paper filters, and it's relatively easy to clean, altho not as easy to clean and make a new pot in some respects compared to electric drip coffeemaker. What I do NOT like is that the bottom (inside) of this coffee pot started showing rusty spots within the first few weeks, and now in less than 3 months of making a pot a day, I strongly suspect that it is simply going to rust all the way through the bottom in the very near future. NOT happy with that, especially considering that we paid double to triple what an electric drip coffee maker would have cost. I wasn't happy having to replace inexpensive drip coffee makers every year--I don't think this one is even going to make it to 6 months.

Presto 12 cup electric percolator,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","My drip coffee maker needed replaced ASAP. The base was getting really hot and that would not be good for safety. Decided a percolator would be the better choice for both taste and longevity. It was the right choice for taste. Won't know about longevity until I get 4-6 years out.

Pros: The design is beautiful, fits with my decor and is a much smaller footprint than the drip maker. Easy to pour. No carafe breakage if bumped. Stainless steel throughout equals easy to clean (but the taste of the coffee improved by letting it season).
Cons: It was a little bit of a learning curve to get the coffee right. It required more coffee to get the taste right as compared to my drip coffee maker, but with that said, the taste was superior in this pot. No automatic features meant I had to buy a cheap timer that would handle the wattage of the pot, not a big deal. I had read up about grounds in the coffee for percolators and solved that problem by also buying French press screens and cutting them to size. One for the bottom and one for the top = no grounds in coffee. No way to really tell when you're at the end of the pot as there's no viewing window is the only feature I miss.

Summary: excellent machine with better tasting coffee that's beautiful to look at and easier to clean if you can deal with the minor hassles plus added expense of a timer and metal screens.",Indigo,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de enero de 2024

Great Pot but...,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This seems like a nice pot. The coffee is piping hot! But when I saw the filter basket I was disappointed - my experience with filters with just holes on the bottom wasn't good - lets too many grounds go through and you must use a paper filter, which I didn't want to do. My old pot, a Hamilton Beach, was very good at not letting many grounds through, but the filter basket had slots rather than holes. (The Hamilton Beach that Amazon has for sale only has the small spout, which I didn't like at all, and the ""retro"" spout model was not available.) Just out of curiosity, I tried the filter basket from my old Hamilton Beach pot and, surprise, it fit the new Presto pot. So I tried the pot with the old filter basket and it makes a great cup of coffee with very little grounds in the coffee. But you must remove the filter basket before you pour any coffee or you will ge grounds in the coffee.

Tips for a genuinely amazing cup of a coffee...,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My family has owned this percolator for 6 years now, purchased right here on Amazon in 2010, and I'm about to buy another one for work.

This pot has consistently delivered the best tasting coffee - better than all restaurants we frequent, better than friends and family's coffee... just awesomely, amazingly good. I've had a couple of minor maintenance issues over the years (see below) but they were super easily overcome, and in general this has been a super-reliable and very inexpensive appliance. Honestly, this has to have been one of my most favorite appliance purchases ever. And all for less than $40. Take THAT, you overpriced, overly featured drip machines that make lousy coffee!! ;-)

*TIPS*

With this, and any other stainless percolator, there are some basic guidelines to follow that aren't necessarily in the manual:

1. DO NOT use a paper filter. Ever. Use the metal basket ONLY. The holes are tiny enough to allow the coffee through, but to keep 99.9% of the gains in. Using the metal basket without a paper filter allows the flavor oils that naturally exist in the coffee bean to STAY in the coffee and contribute to its amazing and full flavor. If you use a paper filter, you'll lose the oils and get an ""over-extracted"" flavor that's more bitter than bold... so don't use a paper filter, follow the instructions, and you're GOLDEN - perfect coffee every time. Yes, you'll get a couple of grains in the last cup without a paper filter... whoop-de-do, just don't drink the very last few drops of the very last cup - problem solved. ;)

2. Cleaning the pot: Make sure it's clear of any build-up, but don't scrub the interior... allow the percolator to become seasoned. It's hot enough to prevent any bacterial issues, just like a wok or a cookie sheet. So let that puppy get seasoned, it's perfectly safe AND more delicious over time! The key place for build up is the receiving ""hole"" at the bottom of the pot for the metal tube. That can build up coffee debris pretty quick, and if you don't clear it, it will keep the metal tube from seating properly and you won't be able to brew properly, if at all. You only need to scrape away the excess with a fingernail, and you're good to go. The outside of the pot, however, feel free to scrub and make super shiny. It's really a nice looking piece when cleaned!

3. Cleaning the basket: The basket's tiny holes can get plugged up over a month or so of daily use. There's two ways to deal with this: chemically (cleaners) or with a wire brush. I prefer the wire brush route and just tap the bottom of the basket, which instantly clears the holes and allows you to keep the years of perfect seasoning intact. Wire brush FTW.

4. When assembling the pot in order to brew coffee, if you don't get the metal tube lined up with the receiving hole in the bottom of the pot, you'll get a misfire where you'll get a weak pot of coffee (at best), if not a mere pot of hot water. To ensure this doesn't happen, once the metal tube is aligned with the receiving hole, twist it left and right like you're trying to gently screw it in. It doesn't actually screw in... the twisting movement simply forces it to pop into the hole if it isn't in the hole already. Best. Trick. Ever.

5. Don't overfill the basket with coffee - the closer you are to the top of the tube, the more likely to get grains in the bottom of the pot. However, don't underfill or you'll get weak coffee. Follow the instructions, and you should be fine.

6. It's OK to let the coffee sit plugged in and ready to go for a long time as a FULL pot. If you're going to be leaving less than half a pot for more than an hour, UNPLUG IT, the coffee can burn if it sits long enough, just like ANY coffee pot. However, I've let a full pot sit for 4 or 5 hours, plugged in, and it's still not bad at all. Obviously, the fresher the better - just don't let it sit plugged in with very little coffee left, or your coffee will be understandably less delicious than you were expecting.

7. MAINTENANCE: I've had to replace the wire/plug once because using it thousands of times caused it to develop a minor short. Any plug/wire off the shelf that fits will do... it's just a straight up, no frills, 2 prong AC cable. Easy-peasy. I've also seen the screws holding on the bottom decay over time as they're not made of rust-resistant metal, sadly. However, a quick trip to your local hardware store will get you brand new ones; just bring the old ones with and ask the hardware guy for help. I replaced the bottom screws about 2 years ago when they got too rusty, so I got 4 years out of mine. You might be able to forestall the rusty screws issue by covering the holes with hot glue to prevent water from getting up in there when you wash the outside. That'd probably work perfectly, but I haven't actually tried it.

Finally, stop reading reviews, buy this pot, and enjoy your awesome coffee!!!",Robb Ryniak,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de octubre de 2016
