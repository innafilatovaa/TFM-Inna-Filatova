Excelente Cafetera,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Após já a usar há muito tempo, diariamente, estou muito satisfeito com esta cafetera. Fácil de usar, basta por o café no filtro e ligar e em poucos minutos o café está pronto e muito saboroso. Ponto o café em pó no filtro, podemos programar a cafetera para só começar a fazer o café a uma determinada hora. Cá em casa pomos o café em pó à noite e programamos a máquina para começar a fazer o café as 7h da manhã. Quando nos levantamos de manhã o café está pronto. A parte de baixo onde pousamos a bilha de vidro do café é em policarbonato, pelo que não oxida com o tempo. Após o café preparado a máquina mantem o café quente por cerca de 45 minutos, depois desliga-se automaticamente. Mas basta tocar num botão e ela rapidamente aquece o café. Quando está ligada emite uma luz azul em toda a volta que dá um aspecto agradável à minha cozinha. Estou muito satisfeito e recomendo.",Rui Pires,Revisado en España el 15 de abril de 2021
Simply the Best,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I love this machine. I have just bought my second. The first one lasted me 8 years. It’s reliable, robust, stylish, easy to clean and produces really great filter coffee every time. The single most important feature of this machine is its hot plate. It keeps your coffee hot - not just warm - but hot, ready to drink hot every time. Yes it cuts out after half an hour which is a good safety feature but you can switch it off and on again every 25 minutes or so and keep it going as required. I am so happy this is available again. I’m buying a spare because I don’t want to come back in 8 years and find they aren’t making it anymore. It’s worth the investment.",L. Notley,Revisado en Reino Unido el 16 de julio de 2024

"From one coffee lover to another, this is awesome","5,0 de 5 estrellas","This is my new best friend.
Awesome, quick and easy filtered coffee.
I evolved my filtered coffee game using this. I previously used a French press for years and as good as that was, this saves me soo much time and it’s awesome to look at.

Has a re-usable & quick wash filter. Simply take out and empty ground coffee in trash and easy rinse and clean. Pop back in and just add water to your desired level. Has a scooper to add your desired coffee strength. You just press a button and it has it all ready in 3-5 minutes. (I’d advise on leaving it to sit for a while longer for a better taste)

It also has a timing function to get the coffee ready for you at a certain time. Pretty cool, but haven’t quite mastered or tried…as it literally takes minutes to make so not fussed, and I don’t have to keep it on throughout the night.

I’d also recommend paying £4.99 extra to get the 3 years warranty. From previous reviews, I’ve heard it hasn’t lasted over a year or so. Could be wrong.

Pros:
• has a plate warmer, so can keep coffee hot and ready to drink again later
• great taste for any coffee choice.
• quick and easy to use. Easy Peasy cleaning
• looks cool af with the blue lights.
• good quality too and value for money. Worth the money
• Has a Timing function

cons:
• Doesn’t have a remote control to change the light colour to different colours. Would be cool",ShaDz Mirza,Revisado en Reino Unido el 5 de julio de 2021
A great purchase for coffee lovers,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I purchased this shortly after purchasing the Sage by Heston Blumenthal the Barista Express Coffee Machine and Grinder, 1700 Watt - Silver as I didn't just want to drink espresso, lattes, etc.

I spent a lot of time deciding which filter machine I would purchase and decided to go with this one after reading the good reviews and seeing the low price.

After it arrived I set about making my first jug of coffee, I was surprised at how easy it was and within 5 minutes my jug was ready! The built in re-usable filter comes in very handy and is really easy to clean. I also like the built in timer feature which allows me to setup the jug before bed and wake up to the lovely smell of freshly made coffee!!

There's also another useful feature which allows you to create half a jug of coffee but still have a strong flavour, I use this a lot during the week when it's just me around and I don't want to consume 1.25L of coffee within the space of a couple of hours!

I think the shower head method works great, it really does help produce very flavorful coffee and it makes sure that none of the coffee in the filter goes to waste (which is a big no no for me!).

The jug is very easy to clean, the lid can be easily removed and re-attached allowing it to have a good soak. The hot plate is also just as easy to clean with a quick wipe down.

The only reason I am giving this machine a four star review instead of five is because of the keep-warm time and jug insulation. This machine keeps the coffee warm for 45 minutes after brewing, if I make a full jug of coffee, it will stay warm for about 1hr 30 mins. If I'm making a half just it's about 1hr.

Apart from the short keep warm time, I still think this is a very good filter coffee machine, I love the shower head brewing method, the design is aesthetically pleasing and the price is good.

I would recommend this coffee machine.",Customer,Revisado en Reino Unido el 7 de junio de 2016
Great coffee machine,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Coffee tastes really good and it stays hot for 30 minutes after processing. It's easy to use. It can be used with or without a filter paper - with an optional filter paper it makes it even easier to clean. Very pleased with this purchase and feel it was a good buy. As it's fairly new and working perfectly we can't comment on how durable it is. If the situation changes will amend this review. Right now, very pleased with it. It arrived very quickly and was well packed. No quibbles at all. Highly recommended.",Mrs P,Revisado en Reino Unido el 22 de enero de 2024
Great,"5,0 de 5 estrellas",I’ve had this coffee machine now for about a month and really happy with it. Fantastic price and makes a good coffee. The timer function is really easy to use and lovely to wake up to a pot of coffee. I use the ‘bean’ button which does a slower brew and makes a stronger coffee. I have been using paper filters following reading the reviews which also makes it easier to clean. Compact size but still has a decent sized jug and looks smart.,Helen waddington,Revisado en Reino Unido el 20 de abril de 2024
Really disappointed for many reasons,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","This looked the part, really pleased how it looks and pours out of the jug, sadly that is the only positive points.

I'll breakdown the review rather than rant too much:
Capacity- Holds 4 mugs worth when fully filled up
Jug - Great at pouring, does not drip, lid is very thin plastic and has no clip, so as you get towards the end of the pout it flaps open, irritating when you are filling up the machine as it gets in the way.
Heat of the plate/Water-Comes out hot but the plate is not the hottest for keeping the heat in the jog. It is pretty much drinking temperature as soon as you pour so little steam from the heat.
Filter - We have actually stated using paper filters with this as you get a fait bit of sediment come through. If you like Turkish coffee then you'll love the last cup in the bottom.
Timer - This is the biggest bug bear of the lot, I didn't realise but apparently in 2015 there was an EU law that meant all coffee machines had to be programmed to switch off after 30-40 minutes. One of the reasons for buying a filter machine is that the coffee machine is there, hot when you want another cup later on. You have to switch the machine off then off again to restart the timer. Of course if you don't do that straightaway then you get luke warm coffee as the plate is not particularly hot so will not heat us the contents. We have wasted more in coffee than saved in electric by this ruining so many pots.

Our previous machine was a 20 year old Morphy Richards machine that was bottom of the range and served us so well over the years. How we now miss that basic but brilliant machine.

Once we have used up our filter papers I think we'll sell this on ebay for a few quid and buy the tea bag pouches for our hot coffee in future as that works great for a single cup.",Steve,Revisado en Reino Unido el 1 de marzo de 2021
Makes more steam than coffee!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",Only had the machine five days but already fed up with mopping condensation off the wall. At least a third of the water disappears in a cloud of steam resulting in condensation and a puddle on the worktop. I’ve resorted to running the machine under an open window but that’s not a long term solution. It also means that you need more water than you estimated before you start and that in turn means a longer runtime - 19 minutes for two half full mugs that have to be topped up with water from the kettle! Back to my old cafetière.,Mags,Revisado en Reino Unido el 4 de abril de 2024
Don’t buy it unless you want to keep cleaning it all the time,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","It looks really good but it just keeps dripping anyway to the base.
Unless you like regular maintenance of this machine - just stay away from it, is awful, initially I thought I a drip or two is fine but it’s just doesn’t stop.

The bottom base is electric ⚡️ so eventually this probably will have problems",Nelson,Revisado en Reino Unido el 26 de abril de 2024
"Was great, when it worked, however...","1,0 de 5 estrellas","The first one of these broke conveniently just outside the 2 year warranty period with the infamous water leaking from the bottom issue.

Never the less because I liked the machine I bought one again and it has now broken with a different fault where excessive steam is produced and no water processed through the machine to the jog. This only after 11 months this time.

Obviously a very poor quality of manufacturing here so enough is enough and will be buying from another brand.

Don't make the same mistake as me and buy from another brand with more reliability.",hello_now_press_go,Revisado en Reino Unido el 28 de octubre de 2023
Flawed design / manufacture,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","In use this machine performs well for the price. Easy to use, makes good coffee.
BUT. In common with many other reviewers, after just 14 months, it started dumping the hot water onto the worktop rather than making coffee with it.
I'm probably more fortunate than most in that I have experience fixing electrical appliances and was disgusted to find one end of the silicone tube carrying the hot water was held in place with friction alone, the puny cable tie intended to fix it was loose. Inevitably, it had blown off.
This is at best a design / manufacture flaw. At worst, it may not be totally unintentional. Such a shame, otherwise a great coffee maker for the price. Simple, if fiddly fix to put a jubilee clip on the joint and it's working perfectly again.",COLIN C,Revisado en Reino Unido el 10 de agosto de 2023

Disappointing.,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This machine looks good and the coffee tastes pretty good, but I think that's as much to do with the coffee as the machine. Unfortunately, that is where the positives end for me.
The 'keep warm' function lasts about an hour if you're lucky. The glass carafe is so thin that any residual heat is lost within minutes. This nonsense about auto shut-offs being a health and safety requirement is bobbins. My previous coffee machine, which is still available, kept the pot warm all day. It brewed a decent coffee too, but it didnt look the part quite as much, so I thought I'd splash out on this one.
The extra strong option brews, in my opinion, a normal cup of coffee, with the alternative being a watery, transparent and tasteless cup of brown water.
Im just a little puffed out with all the extra buttons and needless features. I need a coffee pot that has an on/off button, a hot plate, and looks good. Thats it. I have a clock. I have a brain to remember to switch it off. I can make the right number of cups without being reminded, and I can make it the right strength for my taste.
Im off back to Tesco for my £16 special. I used it nearly all day, every day for 2 years before it finally gave up the ghost. That's not bad for economy of effort. If you want this one, you'll find it on gumtree for a bargain. Only used once!",Stephen,Revisado en Reino Unido el 7 de noviembre de 2021
"Disappointed, I should have done more research before purchasing.","2,0 de 5 estrellas","I have used a small cafetiere for several years and thought I would try filter coffee. Bad choice. I have always enjoyed freshly ground coffee and thought a filter coffee maker might be a little more convenient.

It wasn't. For starters the machine was obviously designed for making batches of coffee to be kept warm and used over several hours. There is no way to set it to deliver a specific number of cupfuls, it simply uses however much water is put in the reservoir before stopping. For a single cup the required reservoir water level was just a few mm. This means making a single cup of coffee was quite a faff compared to my cafetiere. After use the filter container has to be removed for cleaning together with the carafe.

Secondly, when trying to brew a single cup I found the resulting coffee to be undrinkable. It tasted quite harsh but lacking in flavor and was even less palatable than a decent instant coffee.

I can't return the item as it probably does the job it was designed for. I've returned to my trusty cafetiere that always delivers a good cup of coffee and consigned this filter machine to the kitchen cupboard.",Shaman,Revisado en Reino Unido el 27 de agosto de 2022

Over temperature producing steam,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","Worked okay for two months then became very slow to make coffee with large amounts of steam from back of machine.

"HUGE, and doesn't self clean","3,0 de 5 estrellas","We liked the showering function to get water on the grains but in all honesty this is just a regular coffee filter machine.
We're giving only 3 stars because their claims are way off.
-this machine is giant for a standard filter machine. Not suitable for a compact kitchen. SEE PHOTO (standing to the right of a standard filter machine with a 750ml capacity)
This R.H. model is more suitable for making a larger amount, well over a litre.

IT DOESN'T SELF-CLEAN.

It shoots scalding hot steam out the store when you open the lid to remove the wet grinds 5 MINUTES AFTER you turn it off.
The flavour is low unless you press the flavour/strength button.

TIP
if you have a small kitchen and want a lot of Welbourn from your filter coffee, this isn't the model for you. What gives drip coffee more flavour is slightly slowing down the brew process. Best way to do that is using a V Shaped inner cone with disposable paper filter.

These plastic baskets affect the flavour hugely.",pianopedals,Revisado en Reino Unido el 12 de marzo de 2024
Faulty as the machine started to leaking from the bottom,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","The product was faulty and now returned.

If it didn't leak from where the electrics are (potential hazard), I was half tempted to keep.

Maybe this is a problem with a line or a batch as not everyone who purchased this product faced the issue. In one way we were lucky to face the issue on day 2 itself rather than after the warranty period.

Good for the price but got a few negatives,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Firstly, very hard to give a fair review on reliability etc as only had it a day..i may update a few months further on! Very disappointed with whoever supplied this to Amazon as it had clearly been used already! it was fully wrapped and packaged..or re-wrapped I should say. I did note there was no seal in the tab on the top of the box... I took out the filter to wash it etc to help remove any plastic odour which other reviews have noted. I was annoyed to notice some brown staining in the mesh, I checked the rest of the items ..the instruction booklet had a coffee colouted finger print on it! and the inner filter chamber had some dried grounds on it! this had clearly already been used..returned and repackaged. I had no choice but to use it as ive just moved house to a very eural area..needed morning coffee! I cleaned ittherefore but will be passing on a separate complaint to amazon. Re the timer function, it seems to work well but it is NOT quiet...if its going next to a bed..get some earplugs but then negates point of having it prepared with your morning alarm. It is quite quick...took 10 minutes for a 5-6 cup volume.. this equates to 2 large mugs of black coffee. The timer is silent, dont expect a bell or buzzer to tell you oys ready or started brewing. The warm function works well. As this is for my morning wake up in bed coffee the 40 minute post-brew warming is ample. Bodrips from reservoir onto hot plate so far. Majes nice coffee..i think iys down to the coffee you ise rather than the brewimg quality of this machine which seems good. Very lighg piece of kit, good gripped rubber feet. Compact, simple to use, simply pour water straight into reservoir at rear of machine..lift up top lid obvs. Water reservoir is not removeable for cleaning but a simple cloth rinse would do.

Mix of positives & negatives,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","A mix of positive and negatives, coffee improving with each brew (or I'm just getting used to it).

Positives - Much smaller than expected, especially the jug, but looks good and takes up less space on counter top. Design for removable filter container is great, makes it easy to keep clean and water tank access on both sides is very helpful. Really fast brewing haven't timed it but seems to be ready in bearly a minute.

Negatives - The jug is flimsy compared to the Morphy Richards Coffee Maker it replaced (used that one for about 10 years). Pretty sure this won't last as long. Took seven water only runs to get rid of the horrible plastic taste, but ok now. The bean boost (1-4 cups) option on mine doesn't seem to do anything, no light to indicate its even on, I also don't see any point to using the timer option as the time it takes to brew is so fast. Leaves coffee gunge at bottom of jug & cups.

Minor irritants - Cup markings on the jug are black rather than white so once coffee is in the pot you can't see them. Can't use as a clock as the display is dimmed when you switch off.",SHAR,Revisado en Reino Unido el 8 de noviembre de 2022

A cheap product for a cheap price,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Having read a number of Amazon reviews, I opted to buy this over a number of more expensive items as my initial impressions were that it would be perfect to replace my old machine where the carafe had cracked and I just wanted a 'set and forget' machine.
Pro;
The machine is a good size to fit on most counters, brews quicker than my old machine and the hotplate keeps the coffee well.

Con;
However The machine has a number of design flaws.
- The lip where the jug seats in. Whilst this isn't a problem when the lid is open, the spring valve that releases coffee from the filter makes it fiddly in seating the jug sometimes when the lid is closed (which is clicked shut).
- The warm plate time is just 30 mins (my old machine was 2hrs) and provides no audible warning it's turning off.
- The cable from the machine to plug measures 60cm. Like me, this may hinder where you can locate the machine.

The instruction manual shows how to make coffee now and if you want to make less than 5 cups. Wanting more than the 5 cups, I set the machine up to brew but this always leaves 2/3 cups of water in the reservoir that is not brewed. Brewing again works, but is not the 'set and forget' I was looking for.

Overall, the machine produces good coffee promptly. However, with the design flaws and timer issues I wish I had spent a few more pounds on a better machine. Summed up best, ""A rich man buys cheap tools"".",Mr. D. J. Randall,Revisado en Reino Unido el 6 de julio de 2020

Great machine but unclear instructions,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I am not an expert on coffee and I am equally happy with instant as I am with filter. I wanted an inexpensive machine to satisfy visitors to my home who refuse to drink instant. This coffee maker, imho, is perfect for the job. It is reasonably compact and relatively easy to clean.

My main issue with it concerns the manual. I had real trouble trying to get the timer to work. I enlisted my husband’s help but he struggled too. Eventually, he figured it out. The line separating ‘COFFEE LATER’ and ‘ACTIVATION’ needs to go as it’s an essential part of getting the timer to work.

This is what we do:

1. Press the clock symbol button (not sure if this step is necessary but it doesn’t mess anything up). You could possibly start with step 2.
2. Set the current time using the ‘h’ and ‘min’ buttons.
3. Press the clock symbol button again and set the time for when you want the coffee to start brewing. You will have to press the ‘h’ or ‘min’ button (i.e. start setting the brewing time) within 5 seconds, otherwise you will have to start the process from scratch.
4. If making fewer than 5 cups, you will have to press the bean symbol button. The symbol will light up.
5. Press ‘AUTO’.

Coffee machine boi,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","I'm not one for manuals, and that's good, because this guy's manual is about as comprehensive as a book written about Market Capital by a 3 year old who has just learned what money is.

Putting the company's attempt to save really explaining their product aside, the coffee machine is really nice. It has a lovely blue LED lit base and a nice digital screen - which those of you with a digital clock from 1998 would be familiar with - and it keeps coffee nice and hot once it has generated around 5 minutes of sputtering and spewing noises and then dripped the coffee into the pot in a way that I am sure the coffee shall be at my usual standard of light absorbing black.

The timer is the real hero here, before this thing I used to have to make my own coffee in the morning, whilst summoning the energy to start my day and not pass out on my floor whilst waiting for the kettle to boil and the French press to brew. I set this thing for around 5 minutes before my alarm goes off and by the time I get downstairs it's made me a lovely hot coffee - it's nicer to see in the morning than any spouse.

Some tips:
Only put as much water in as you need to make the coffee, there's no option to select cup quantities. I usually put around (by the machines metric on the side) 4 mugs of coffee in for 2 fairly large, Friends' style mugs of coffee in the morning. If you're into a strong coffee (like me) then hit the 1-4 button, I don't know whether it's placebo or if it actually does anything, but I feel better once I've pressed it.

The brewing takes 5 minutes with 4 coffee machine cup metrics of water. It produced enough heat on the top to warm your milk, if you're that way inclined, or to at least warm an egg to a loose scrambling temperature. Since having the machine I've scrapped my electricity payment and instead use the steam it generates to rotate a turbine that converts to electricity. It's a real money saver and a feature I'd expect the manufacturer to play on more in the folded A4 sheet manual.

Good machine. Buy it.",Ryan,Revisado en Reino Unido el 25 de agosto de 2020
An Excellent Purchase,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought this a few weeks back, and my partner and I are very pleased with it. The coffee this machine produces is hot (but not tongue burning), and extracts the flavour of the grounds beautifully. The coffee grounds are fully used from the well designed shower-head style water jet, making for more flavoursome coffee, and better economy per cup.

Easy to use, and the manual well explains the functions. The self timer to turn on the machine at a given time is fantastic. My partner and I love waking up to fresh coffee, much improving our morning routine, and making getting fresh coffee in the morning much less of a hassle. The keep warm feature keeps the coffee just as hot as when it was just brewed for a good 40 minutes or so before switching off. This makes it possible to be running behind schedule (or to have a short lie in) and still have hot coffee in the morning.

The machine is quick, and quiet; a great improvement on our old machine. Honestly, you could easily make a cup of coffee before the rest of your household has awoken, and none bar the lightest of sleepers would wake.

Easy to clean, and maintain. All of the parts (including reusable filter) can be put into a dishwasher so long as they're on the top shelf. The lid of the carafe comes off too if you are careful about the direction of the hinges (they have a small opening which is aligned with vertical when the lid is fully open). My partner and I would insist that you ensure you follow the instructions and run water through the system before use. This should ensure that the plastic-like taste and smell is washed out before use (or at least, it did for us).

Overall, a fantastic product and well worth the money spent. Would recommend to any filter coffee lovers!",Andrew Hannington,Revisado en Reino Unido el 24 de agosto de 2017
Straightforward to use. Slightly improved on previous version but same good coffee maker.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Like the simplicity of this. A new inner filter has been added to the coffee holder which is good.
Easy to look after.",Evelyn P,Revisado en Reino Unido el 4 de mayo de 2024
