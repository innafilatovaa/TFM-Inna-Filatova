Works like a charm,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I recently purchased a Yama siphon coffee maker to replace a Bodum unit.

Improved taste!!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I am a great fan of coffee and have been using the hario siphon with the bamboo filter cloth. I found that if the cloth wasn't really well cleaned after use by bleaching and rinsing really well, it left a residual aftertaste in the next lot of coffee which was really noticeable.

Awesome siphon filter! No sediment! Take photo of it new so you can reassemble.,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Awesome siphon filter. It makes using a siphon so much easier than a cloth filter and there is ZERO sediment in the cup. With cloth filters, you need to soak them in a cleaning solution and the rinse them out like forever to get all the detergent out and then hang them to dry and then seal them in a plastic bag so they don’t absorb odors. With the metal screen filter, you can use whatever detergent you want and since it’s stainless steel, it won’t absorb the soap or fragrance as long as you rinse it well. The actual metal screen is just an off the shelf espresso machine filter screen so replacements are easy to come by at any e-store that sells espresso machine parts.

I reviewed a lot of the negative comments on this item and I can attribute the issues to a few factors:

1. They have not cleaned their filter screen properly after each use. To do this, get a sponge or scrub brush and slather the screen with detergent and scrub both sides and try to pass the soapy foam through the filter screen and scrub both sides. Rinse with hot water. Also, and this is important, try to rotate the fine mesh screen in a circle around the stainless steel base. This will dislodge any coffee oils and fines that have collected between the mesh screen and the steel base. Keep doing this and rinsing until the screen rotates fairly easily. This entire operation should take less than two minutes to accomplish. Do NOT try to separate the mesh screen from the steel base. It is not meant to be removed.

2. They have re-assembled the unit incorrectly after cleaning. When you take your filter out of the box, take a photo of how it’s assembled. The ceramic disk needs to be in the correct orientation for this thing to work properly. Also make note of how the silicone gasket is oriented. If either of these are in the wrong position, the filter will not work properly.

3. They have either tightened the screen screw way too tight or they have it too loose. After cleaning and assembly, tighten the screw all the way just hand tight. Then loosen the screw about a half rotation or so to ensure that there is a minor amount of slop between the screen, gasket and ceramic disk while maintaining a seal with the channel in the gasket. This will permit the flow of coffee and micro fines through the screen without clogging. Too tight and that will limit the flow of coffee making draw down extremely long. Too loose will result in lots of fines and even grounds in the lower pot.

4. They are not stopping the brewing cycle by using a cold wet cloth wrapped around the lower pot. After you pre-determined brew time (usually one to two minutes), rinse a facecloth or handi-wipe with cold water (squeeze out excess) and wrap it around the lower pot making sure that the part of the pot that is empty is covered (you are chilling the air inside the pot). This will quickly draw down the coffee to the lower pot by increasing the vacuum pressure in the lower pot and will speed up the draw down. Usually, when the coffee is about all drained into the lower pot, it has a tendency to want to travel to the upper pot again. At that point, re-rinse the cloth with cold water again and wrap around the lower pot and you will see the tube clear and you will hear the air going into the lower pot. For me, along with the 90 second brew time, the entire cycle from brewing to completely draining ranges between five to eight minutes with darker roasted or softer beans making the cycle last on the longer side.

5. Grinding too fine. You want the grind size to be #20 mesh which is slightly more coarse than what you use for filter drip. Search on Amazon for test sieves and buy yourself a #10, #20 and #30 sieve along with a catch pan and lid. Or buy swatches of those mesh screens. Assemble them in descending order and whatever is caught by the #10 screen is #20 mesh. This will help you determine what grinder setting to use. You want the majority of the coffee to be in that #20 mesh range. Doesn’t have to be exact or perfect, just in the ballpark.

Anyway, using this filter along with a BLUEFIRE Butane burner and electric kettle has made making siphon coffee comparatively quick and easy to the point where it’s fast and easy enough to use a siphon for my morning coffee. I use this with a Hario TCA-5 siphon and I’ve been loving life ever since.

This little vacuum siphon filter is pretty great,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this product.
It's quite heavy in the hand (due to the ceramic body)
The seal is quite nice, and it comes apart easily enough for cleaning.

The only thing I have to watch out for is because it's so heavy it could break the glass of the siphon if dropped or allowed to swing into it too hard.

Nice Filter,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Nicely built filter. Very clean cup, at least as good as with the cloth filter. Very fine mesh...takes a little getting used to as you have to change the grind to suit.. Soft rubber. Exceptionally fast delivery. The only negative is both the spring and the chain are significantly shorter than those on my Yama SY8 vacuum pot. It works, but the chain just barely appears out the bottom of the pick up tube, and the spring must be pulled excessively to make it hook. Another review, posted elsewhere makes mention of the spring deforming, leading to leakage. This is not surprising, given how far it has to stretch to work on the Yama-8. This may also be why another reviewer (again elsewhere) said the rubber deformed and deteriorated. I took the chain and spring from the old cloth filter and installed it on the new filter...problem solved. It would be five stars but for the chain/spring problem...if it holds up.",Maurice,Revisado en Canadá el 10 de enero de 2017
The plastic silicone ring that holds the filter has plasticky odor!,"1,0 de 5 estrellas","I wanted to love this product but unfortunately I can’t!

The product has two major flaws:

1) As soon as you take the filter out from its package, you can smell the foul unpleasant pungent. The odor is extremely unbearable that it smells like melted plastic. To rid off the odor, I tried soaking it with soap water and in boiled soda water. None of these methods work! When I soaked the filter ring in hot water for half the day until it gets cold. I took the filter out of the water. When I took a sniff at the water. Oh my god! I almost puke! I can smell the foul odor has already transferred into the water! Just imagine drinking it!
The coffee I made from this filter doesn’t have a distinctive odor or taste because coffee flavor overtaken the foul pungent. But with pure water I can smell it!

2) When the water rise to the top chamber, there’s a sudden burst of bubble coming from the middle of the filter. To extract the possible flavor, one must control the water in its most stable condition such as tiny bubbles. The huge bubbles will erupt or affect the overall extraction! That’s a huge disappointment!

In conclusion, I’m extremely unsatisfied with the product! Returning it soon!",Kin Goku Kai,Revisado en Canadá el 19 de noviembre de 2022
Ceramic Disc NOT Flush,"1,0 de 5 estrellas",I purchased this filter and it arrived the next day. Tried a brew in my Bodum siphon and notice two things. It definitely drained slower than the original Bodum plastic filter necessitating a coarser grind but also noticed some grinds in the final cup. when I took it apart to wash only then did I notice that the ceramic disc was warped and not flush. I imagine that this allowed the grinds to leak through. On reassembly I tried tightening it down REALLY tight to close the gap but this caused the metal filter disc to deform to the ceramic disc shape and I didn't get a good enough fit in the top jar and the vacuum was spotty. Very disappointed. I really wanted to like this device hence the 1 star.,Tortoise,Revisado en Canadá el 30 de marzo de 2019

"Skip this one, buy another or stick with the original filter.","1,0 de 5 estrellas","This filter is abhorrent. I used it once and it worked fairly well, it still allowed the coffee through too slow making the coffee taste over brewed. Not the fresh clean taste you normally expect from a siphon.

I typically use a pourover grind (18-20 on my Baratza Virtuoso), and is what I used here. I then tried cleaning it like a few suggested, same thing. Even switching to a coarser grind didn't help much. I wasted a lot of good coffee beans trying to dial this thing in. The other problem with this filter is the stack height causes excess coffee to be left in the top chamber.

"Nicely made item, just does not work for me.","2,0 de 5 estrellas","I really wanted to like this, but just couldn't get along with it. I normally use a Cona glass drainer rod and my coffee returns to the lower bowl within a minute. This takes nearer 5, even with the grind about 50% coarser. It also doubles the time the coffee takes to rise into the upper funnel; it must be a really fine mesh. It does, in fairness, make a much cleaner cup of coffee than a glass drainer, but the taste is similar; it's hard to assess how much the over-extracting is affecting the taste. There is also a strange onion smell that comes from the filter, although I can't taste it in the coffee. All in all, I much prefer the taste and consistency of my glass drainer and am sending this back.
Whilst this is great for travelling there are a couple of things that I think may become issues longer term: The really fine powdery grinds are sucked onto the mesh. I am sure after a few months that this and any oils will start this clogging badly, it also means it is best to clean it immediately.
The other thing that is a worry after a glass drainer is the spring clip that holds it in the funnel. I have seen many good coffee syphons end up with chipped funnels from these things.
Others are obviously fine with this - it is a really nicely made item. I think I habe just been spoiled coming from a glass drainer rather than a cloth one.",DJT,Revisado en Reino Unido el 20 de junio de 2017

"Not bad, not great","3,0 de 5 estrellas","This is a decent quality replacement that will fit almost all brands of syphon coffee maker and removes the need to buy cloth or paper filters in perpetuity. I have mine fitted to the Gourmia electric syphon coffee maker machine and it fits perfectly. It is easy to wash, and easy to fit and remove, indeed much better than the cloth filter the machine came with. My lukewarm rating however is because I find occasionally about half of the coffee won't drain back down into the lower carafe. I've tried stirring during brewing and after, but sometimes nothing will work. The coffee just seems to block the drainage through the filter. I use ground coffee bought from Sainsbury's which is a standard grade I've used for many years in filter machines. It's possible this requires a coarser grade of grind, and yet 70% of the time, this works absolutely fine. I wash the filter after every use so I can't explain why this happens but it's annoying, especially when pressed for time in the morning. I've disassembled the filter to clean and check for blockages, but can't find anything that explains this problem. So in conclusion I'd have to say that when this works, it works well. It's well made, easy to fit and easy to clean. Occasionally however it will drive you bonkers. Good... but flawed. I hope this has been helpful.",JD,Revisado en Reino Unido el 14 de junio de 2019
Odd product,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I got this something like a month ago. I've been changing a lot about my coffee habit, so I can't really isolate whether it changes the taste compared to the cloth that came with my coffee maker, but I haven't noticed a particular issue with the taste.

I have the Yama siphon coffee maker, and the first issue I ran into with this filter is the spring is very strong and short, so it took a lot of pulling with pliers to get it onto the bowl in the first place. I'm not a particularly strong person, but I am male and it was still quite a struggle. I would some of my friends to need help with it, which is not true at all with the spring that came on the Yama's filter. I don't know if that applies to the Hario Siphon coffee maker, so your mileage may vary.

Additionally, even on first use immediately after a clean with soap and water, I noticed the flow rate is very slow. Others seem to think the filter is clogged, even when it's slow on the first try. I actually am more inclined to suspect the issue is that the seal is bad, so there's less pressure difference between the chambers. That means it's relying less on the vacuum property of siphon coffee makers and more on gravity, which will result in slower drains even with a cloth filter. I do see the air rush from the top to the bottom when it's done draining (which means there is *a* pressure difference), but I've also seen unexpected disturbances before I take the heat off which makes me believe there is air transfer before the vacuum is supposed to take effect.",Ben,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de marzo de 2019
Seems to be clogged beyond my ability to clean it.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","Initially this worked well enough. My only doubt the first time was that the level of the filter inside the top vessel would cause more moisture to remain in the top, and this would make the grounds more messy to deal with. That really wasn't an issue. After each use I left it to dry and then emptied out the grounds. I then back washed the filter and cleaned out any remaining grounds by washing. After a few weeks we noticed that the coffee was taking a long time to filter. I dismantled the filter and cleaned it in detail. I can't find any way to clean it further. Soon after this it pulled a fairly hard vacuum and I had to prize the seal out to allow us to get to the coffee that had filtered. I cleaned the filter again but still couldn't restore the previous performance. I put the filter screen in descaler for a few hours, no bubbles and no difference, it isn't scale. I suppose very fine coffee powder has become stuck in the holes. So now what? I reverted to the original cloth filter, which is comparatively fast and easy to clean. I can't get it to look clean, but I also don't have to wait ten minutes. I have been using a bur grinder on one of its coarsest settings, the suggested setting for a cafetière. So this has been added to the curiosity draw.",Chris H,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de marzo de 2019
"Nice, but ...","3,0 de 5 estrellas","... not sure if it's this filter or I am doing something wrong. Let me explain. If I dump the coffee grinds into the empty container while the hot water is heating up, when the semi-hot water begins to channel water upward and begins to mix with the grinds, there's a back flow of water back down into the bottom pot - not a lot, but enough to color the remaining boiling water in the pot brown. The first 3 or 4 times I did this, no back flow of brown liquid, but now it does it every time.

I have to wait for the water to (mostly) empty from the bottom pot and into the upper brewing container before coffee is poured for brewing.

I've watched several videos on best ways to use coffee vacs and get 2 different methods in when to pour coffee into the top container, so maybe that's just the way it is.

"Seems OK for current Vacuum coffee pots, problems with older American ones.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Looks to be a very well made filter for most current vacuum coffee makers but it does not fit many of the older ones. Specifically it is too large in diameter to fit into the recess on old wide mouth Cory units or stainless steel Nicro units. I have a narrow mouth Silex, a Cona and a Yama 5 cup vacuum coffee makers on the way and will report on the fit and use with those coffee makers when they arrive. Looking at photos they should be fine. The outside diameter of the filter disc is 2.54"" or 64.5mm while in comparison the Nicro all steel filter disc is 2.04"" or 52mm in diameter.

The filter disc is three layers, a ceramic bottom with eight holes in it, a steel inner frame which supports the screen and the filter screen. The filter screen is held in place by a sheet metal collar and that is surrounded by the silicone outer ring which extends below the ceramic piece and seals the filter against the bottom of a flat or concave curved glass vacuum top pot bottom surface. The filter screen appears to be finer mesh than that used for the permanent screen filter baskets used in many drip coffee makers. The filter mesh is tight enough so no noticeable coffee grounds or mud in brewed coffee even when grind is espresso. Impressive.",Richard H.

"Good coffee, not easy to clean.","4,0 de 5 estrellas","Bought this after using up a few cloth filters, I wanted to find something more long-term. This is as much as 25 cloth filters, so it's gonna take a while for that cost to even out. With that said, I think it dose taste better over all. The cloth you can never get truly clean, and it will continually be getting more and more dirty as you use it. If this is cleaned properly, you get no residual flavor. But it is honestly not the easiest thing to clean. And brew time has gone up a bit, but if anything I have been getting better coffee from it.",Morgan Sickler,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 23 de agosto de 2022
Absolutely Essential,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",I consider this an absolutely essential add-on for a coffee siphon. The other filtering options for this particular brewing method are just not sustainable if you're using it to brew coffee every day. It's held up to months of daily use with no sign of meaningful wear nor change in functionality while not giving the coffee the slight off note that cloth filters do.,Vlademir1,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de enero de 2023
Works great but the chain could be a little heavier.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas",This is light years ahead of the cloth filter I got with my syphon. I love that it’s nice and heavy. My only gripe is that the chain could be a little heavier to keep it from getting forced up by the boiling water as it’s being pushed up into the brew chamber. This moves the filter and allows some grinds to make its way down the tube.,Tony Harding,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de octubre de 2021
New life for the Vacuum Pot,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","This filter changes the procedure of making a vacuum pot. I used this on both the hario and the bodum and found that the plastic and paper filters work too quickly resulting in underextraction and watery coffee. This filter takes time and effort in both brewing and cleaning however, when using a variety of different grind sizes and coffee types the filter seems to outperform both the standard plastic and even the upgraded paper filters. I found also that introducing the coffee just slightly after the water has started coming into the top glass yeilded slightly less bitter results. If you love brewing coffee and experimenting with the processes than this filter is truly a must have. No more paper flavour, no more plastic flavour just good, clean, oily coffee packed with the flavour it came with.",Scott,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de enero de 2016
"Prompt delivery, accurate dimensions.","5,0 de 5 estrellas","I bought this to fit a vintage Flavor-Seal syphon coffee perk. The dimensions stated were accurate. It fits perfectly, and works like a charm! I’m very pleased with it.",Kathy,Revisado en Canadá el 22 de abril de 2022
Works well,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I'm new to syphon coffee brewing. This filter works well. I am currently switching back and forth between the cloth filter and this SS filter and this what I've observed so far. I use a very fine grind, similar to expresso grind.
My first use of this filter resulted in a thicker brew - but I found that the screw was not tighten completely. After tightening the screw just snug tight, the thickness of the brew went away and was much more pleasant.
The SS filter results in a slightly stronger brew which I think is due to the hold time. It both fills and drains slower than the standard cloth filter on my syphon brewer, which creates a couple minute longer brewing time.
I find it easy to open up and clean.
The spring setup is appropriately sized for my syphon and I've had no issues with leakage around the seal.
Overall, I prefer this filter and will likely transition to using it exclusively once the cloth filter wears out.",KE,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 29 de marzo de 2022
Excellent addition to a Siphon Coffee Maker,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Well made, easy to clean and works well in brewing clean coffee what more could I ask for.",Toby J.W. Head,Revisado en Reino Unido el 11 de junio de 2019
