Very pretty in my kitchen but it stopped working,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","This is an updated review. My last review was 5 stars but I have an update.
I love the coffee maker itself, but the glass mug that‚Äôs included came broken. It‚Äôs NBD, but disappointing because it seemed like it was a nice mug.

UPDATE: The day after I wrote the previous review the coffee maker stopped working completely. It lasted less than three months.
Bottom line : It‚Äôs a beautiful coffee maker but it certainly doesn‚Äôt last. Don‚Äôt waste your money.",Annette,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de junio de 2024
Brilliant morning coffee,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","just following the instructions and no worries. attractive, compact, uncomplicated coffee machine...the one I had in my own imagination that someone finally created. thank you! this is for one at a time cup of coffee but also quick to refill and make a couple more. I like to choose my own coffee blend so this is perfect. Just add a frothing machine to your coffee station and you are set!",BAsh,Revisado en Canad√° el 29 de mayo de 2024
So cute!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Been using this for about two months and it works great! It‚Äôs even smaller than I thought it would be, super cute. Came with the little glass mug as well. A regular mug won‚Äôt fit under there just fyi!",D,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de mayo de 2024

one or two cup,"3,0 de 5 estrellas",easy to use and instead of making 4 cup of coffee. least not wasting on coffee.,Aline,Revisado en Canad√° el 10 de abril de 2024
Love it! ‚Ä¶at first,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I really hope this machine will stay efficient as it is right now. Coffee is brewed fast, is tasteful, water is hot, works like a charm. Also pretty quiet. Reservoir is removable. Love the design and the fact that you have 2 choices (k cup style / ground coffee). The cup that came with it is a nice touch. Love it ‚ô•Ô∏è

UPDATE Daughter ‚Äústole‚Äù my first coffee machine so I ordered an other one. Had to returned it because of the leaking. My feeling is that I bought something new and I suspect it was used. Leaks. Cover of the water emplacement difficult to close. And the round front piece of cup holder seems loose. I‚Äôm not enjoying it anymore.",Manon G.,Revisado en Canad√° el 3 de abril de 2024
Too small,"3,0 de 5 estrellas",It‚Äôs cute and compact and has a nice esthetic but an average size coffee cup will not fit in the slot.,Karli F.,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de marzo de 2024
Would be great if it actually made coffee ‚òï,"2,0 de 5 estrellas","üîπINTRO & DESCRIPTIONüîπ

I was on the lookout for a new coffee maker, and wanted something small and compact for my new kitchen. I am not a huge coffee drinker, as I just tend to have one cup a day, so I thought this machine would be perfect.

So, lets start with the good points :-

üîπPROS - what I really likedüîπ

‚úÖ Arrives very well packaged, in it‚Äôs own branded box. There is plenty of moulded foam surrounding the machine and the accessories ensuring safe delivery.

‚úÖ Comes complete with a glass coffee cup, power cord, attachment for coffee granules, attachment for KCup pods, plastic measuring scoop, stainless steel scoop, cleaning brush and instruction booklet.

‚úÖ Machine is compact, and has a modern sleek design. The champagne colour is more of a ‚Äúnude‚Äù colour, but will blend in with most decor.

‚úÖ One button operation.

‚úÖ Removable water tank for ease of filling.

‚úÖ Quiet operation.

Now onto the not so good ...

üîπCONS - or should I say ‚Äúareas for improvement‚Äùüîπ

‚ùå The main problem here, and this is a big one, is that I have yet to successfully brew a cup of coffee in this machine. I used the attachment for ground coffee, and placed it in the machine. I made sure there was enough water in the reservoir, and switched it on. The coffee started to drip through very slowly, and then stopped. The end result was about 1 inch of coffee in the mug. I recorded the whole process, so you will see from my video what happened.

‚ùå Glass coffee cup feels very thin and fragile.

‚ùå The pods that the machine can use are called KCups, which I am not familiar with, and they don‚Äôt seem to be readily available in the UK. You cannot substitute Nespresso/Tassimo or Dolce Gusto pods as these are a different size.

K Cups are made by Keurig and are a US brand. Compatible pods are available on Amazon, but I have not yet tried these. They retail for approximately ¬£21 for 48 pods.

üîπOPINIONüîπ&üîπCONCLUSIONüîπ

In conclusion, despite my high hopes for this machine, it has failed to deliver. It looks great, and care has been taken to make sure it is well packaged, but when it comes down to what it is actually designed to do, and that is to make coffee, it has failed miserably. What use is a coffee maker which doesn‚Äôt make coffee?

I do feel disappointed, but I may well order some pods to see if they work, but if they don‚Äôt then I am throwing away more money. I have not completely given up on the machine, and if the results improve I will certainly update my review accordingly, but as things stand, I cannot recommend this machine.

Thank you for reading my review, and I hope this, along with my short video will be helpful to you.",Butterfly Kisses,Revisado en Reino Unido el 10 de febrero de 2024
As described,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Love it!!!!! It came with a cup as well. Work as described. Yes, I recommend this product.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en Canad√° el 2 de marzo de 2024
"Pretty design, good as an office/desktop coffee machine","4,0 de 5 estrellas","I have been using singleserve pod coffee machines for some time and I love the convenience to just make one cup when I want it. I got this to keep in my office so that I can conveniently brew a cup.

The design of this machine is quite attractive and unusual, with the rounded shape and open middle. I happen to like pink, so this is a great colour for my office. I also really like that this machine comes with two brewing cartridges: one for store-bought pods, and the other is to add your own coffee grounds.

This machine makes a decent cup of coffee as you would expect from a pod based system.

There were a couple of things that I do not care for about this machine.

The first is that the water reservoir does not come off of the base and so you have to pour water in. In addition, it does not hold very much water so you have to constantly refill it from a pitcher. I would prefer to be able to remove the reservoir and fill it from the tap, and for it to hold a little bit more water.

The second thing I don‚Äôt like about it is that the space available for the cup is quite small. It comes with a lovely glass cup, but it is too small a space to fit my taller mug that I prefer to use. For me, this is a problem worthy of losing a star, because this machine limits you to what mugs you can use with it.

In terms of value, this is competitively priced for what it is. Its attractive design and relatively small size makes it good for an office.",Laura Earwicker,Revisado en Canad√° el 17 de enero de 2024
Easy to use and very quiet,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee maker came very well packaged in the original box. I was surprised how small and lightweight this coffee maker was, we can use it anywhere in the office or at home because it does not take up much space and it‚Äôs very quiet. The packaging includes the machine and 2 KCUP adapters which are one for the capsules and the other for ground coffee. The use was very easy, the water heats up very quickly, we just have to fill the water tank up to the max line with water and put the capsule or fill it with ground coffee the Kcup adapter. The packaging also included a small glass mug, perfect for making cappuccino that I drink every day. With this coffee maker, we can also make tea in addition to coffee, and I like the fact that it is very easy to clean. In general, it is a very good coffee maker and I think the price is reasonable.",A.R,Revisado en Reino Unido el 9 de febrero de 2024
"compact and nice design, one tourch setting","5,0 de 5 estrellas","This coffee machine is specially designed for single people, and it has many features that attract me:
1. Very nice appearance and design, nice pink color and fashionable appearance design
2. There are two removable filter adapters, which can make both coffee and tea, making it easy to rinse and clean.
3. One-touch operation is very convenient and fast.
4. It can be used with ground coffee and is also compatible with 4-8oz K-cups.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the design and quality. It‚Äôs just that the water capacity is too small, so water needs to be added frequently.",Stacy z,Revisado en Canad√° el 22 de enero de 2024
Elegant coffee maker that is easy to use...,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Single button coffee maker that is beautiful and easy to use with single serve coffee.

The machine takes 20 seconds to heat up and right after it's ready to brew hot drinks.
I was able to use different small cups which as long as you can fit the small cup under the coffee machine then you will be fine to make coffee.

The waste bucket is removable and can be easily clean through rising.
Overall, this is a nice little machine that helps me wake up in the morning with excitement.",Rin's Reviews,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de febrero de 2024
Brewing Bliss,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I was thrilled upon discovering this product. It not only met my expectations but exceeded them. The package included an instruction manual, a filter adapter, an extra filter adapter, and a small glass cup that pairs perfectly with the machine. The compact size allows for portability, making a single cup of coffee or tea effortlessly. Whether using coffee cups, ground coffee, or brewing tea, the process was simple, and it rapidly heated the water. Consistently delivering hot beverages, the machine was easy to clean, and I appreciated the automatic shut-off feature after brewing. The only drawback was its limited mug size compatibility, fitting only small mugs. Despite this, it performed exceptionally well, making the overall coffee/tea experience quick and enjoyable.",Jen,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de diciembre de 2023
