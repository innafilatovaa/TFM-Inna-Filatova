Easy for a first timer!,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","Got this for my husband for Christmas. He's pretty new to coffee and has never made his own. This was recommended as a great option for the novice to achieve a good, consistent cup of pour-over coffee - and it definitely fits the bill. Easy to use. Easy to wash. It's been a hit here.",Miss Teri Jack,Revisado en Canadá el 20 de enero de 2024

Makes good coffee but requires patience (and filters!!),"5,0 de 5 estrellas","My husband is really gotten into trying to make the best cup of coffee lately. He's following James Hoffmann watching all his videos, and trying different coffee makers himself. We already had a collection of coffee makers, including a chemex and several pour-overs, but I bought this for him because we didn't have this exact maker. I personally don't like it very much but he's been using it everyday. What I don't like is that you have to pour a little bit, wait, pour a little bit, wait, pour little bit, wait just to make one cup of coffee. The basket portion is small so you just don't have any choice but to keep pouring a little bit at a time. I much prefer the Aeropress where I can pour the hot water, stir it a little bit, and I have my cup of joe.
If you like to tinker with pour time, fiddle with pouring patterns and that kind of thing you might like this. If you like to make a cup of coffee pretty quickly, this is not the maker for you.
It is very well made and I like that it's glass and can be cleaned with just a rinse.
You also need to get the filters that fit this maker. I saw a good tip somewhere that might help you if you're using this: when you need to get the coffee into the basket, if you already have an Aeropress, use the funnel for that to add the coffee to the Kalita. That way it won't end up with grounds on the wrong side of the filter.
Speaking of filters, mine did not come with any filters and I didn't order them at the same time, so I had we had to wait for my next order of the special filters to come. As previously mentioned, I don't have a lot of patience, so the 3-day wait for filters sort of irritated me. That's on me for not reading the product description, but hopefully you will know to order filters at the same time.
The coffee is good but I'm not patient enough to use this one. I'll probably end up buying the 185 too to see if I can tolerate how long it takes to make one cup of coffee with that.",H N Jones,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de agosto de 2022

Is this thing a toy?,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I read plenty of reviews on this and I saw a couple that mentioned the larger was too big and that they had to get the small. I opened the box and thought oh, how cute. This is not a good thing. My cup of coffee in the morning is 25 grams of ground coffee to 400ml of water. The 25 grams came to the very top of this thing. Literally... to the top. There was literally no way for me to brew a cup of coffee with this tiny thing. I hear such great things about the Kalita Wave but it will be a few months before I can purchase the 185 so I am not at all happy. Who brews 7 to 10 grams of coffee? That isn't even a cup! Now I have this thing with a pack of filters, a waste of $30 combined that are unusable for me. Be warned, this may be a great option if want a wee tiny cup of coffee, but if you want to brew anything that has more than 10 grams of ground coffee do not purchase this thing. I seriously wanted to give this one star but it is a usable product that is built just fine. It is just way to small for my needs.",subcell,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de marzo de 2019

Not optimal for really fresh coffee.,"3,0 de 5 estrellas","I've used the Hario V60 and the Beehouse drippers prior to using the Kalita Wave 155. I use 26 grams of coffee for my 12 oz cup. The Kalita Wave is barely big enough for that volume is you're using fresh coffee. The pre-wet and bloom pours will come right to the very top, so there is little room for error in that regard. I was skeptical of such a small dripper having 3 holes in the bottom, but using the Kalita spec filters the flow rate was okay and the finished cup pretty good. I would prefer it to be a bit slower and that the brew filter capacity were a bit larger to allow for more bloom.",CN,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de septiembre de 2016

Small but Mighty,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Like others, I was surprised by how small this item is, but once I got the hang of how to use it, (how much coffee to use, how much water, how fast to pour, etc) it makes a great cup of coffee and is a perfect size for a single mug.
I am the only person who drinks coffee in my family, so I don't need the larger size. I got the glass version, it does not dissipate heat like stainless, and is easier to keep clean without developing stains than ceramic. Dump out the grounds and a rinse and dry is all that is needed to be ready for the next cup.
Because the filter size can not be found in stores, you need to remember to order new filters before the old ones run out.",Amazon Customer,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de enero de 2021

New to the pour over game? This is the dripper to use.,"4,0 de 5 estrellas","Very easy to use, well made, and a consistent brew. The three small holes in the flat bottom help the brew cycle to make sure the water isn't just ""funneled through."" By far the best method I've found in that ever elusive search for the perfect cup of coffee.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is....its small. When they say 1-3 cups it's misleading. Most cups of coffee are 21-25 grams of grounds which fills up most of the filter paper. Nevertheless, perfect size for individual cups of coffe.",JJ,Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de abril de 2016
Fast and Easy to Use - No weird tastes,"5,0 de 5 estrellas","I had to get this coffee dripper from somewhere else, as this package was lost in the mail.
I'll provide a review of the product though:

I've tried a few drippers before but this one made the coffee the best tasting and the smoothest. Each dripped I used, I used the same filer and same coffee amounts.
The last one I used was a plastic dripped and it seemed to have changed or added another taste to the coffee. It also made the coffee a bit bitter.
With this glass dripper, there is a significant change in taste from this glass dripper and the plastic one. This glass dripper makes a very smooth and authentic coffee taste.
It could be due to the shape of the dripper too, no ridges on the sides, 3 dripping holes instead of 1, and/or just that the material is glass and not plastic.

One must be careful though, as the glass is thin and feels easy to break.

Overall, the best dripper I've owned so far and hoping to use this for quite some time.",Adrien,Revisado en Canadá el 21 de diciembre de 2018
